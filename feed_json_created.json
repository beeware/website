This is part of a larger set of changes cleaning up the implementation of <code>Canvas</code>.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4047\">add a bitmap image on a <code>Canvas</code></a>.</li>\n<li>We made a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4042\">large internal refactor of the <code>Table</code> and <code>Tree</code> widgets</a>. This is the first step in improving the API for defining <code>Table</code> and <code>Tree</code> widgets to exposed some long-needed capabilities like sorting and specifying column widths.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4138\">hardened the definition for providing icons in <code>Table</code> and <code>Tree</code> column data</a>. The documented API has been specific for some time, but hasn't been implemented consistently on all platforms.</li>\n<li>We modified the way Source objects are used to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4032\">ensure that widgets no longer listen to stale sources when data changes</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4063\">formalized the protocol definitions for data source listeners</a></li>\n<li>We corrected some issues with the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4010\">display of <code>OptionContainer</code>s on Cocoa and GTK when content is changed on a non-visible tab</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected a number of <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4043\">layout issues on iOS and iPad apps</a>, including introducing the ability for iPad apps to operate in non-full screen mode.</li>\n<li>We corrected some issues with <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4034\">scroll handling in <code>ScrollContainer</code> on macOS</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected some issues with <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4099\">widget colors in dark mode on macOS</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected some <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4016\">memory leak issues with Android widgets</a>.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4026\">use the Python standard library <code>webbrowser</code> module in Toga Android apps</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected the use of <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3751\">theme colors in <code>DetailedList</code> on Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to be <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4036\">notified when a website completes loading on Android</a>.

This also involved updates to tools including <code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>auditwheel</code>, Meson, and Python's own Android testbed. We hope to upstream these patches to the corresponding projects in the near future.</li>\n<li>We resolved an issue with <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/144315\">Android buildbot testing in CPython</a>. Both Android Buildbots stopped working in mid December for two different reasons; the cause of the problems is not entirely understood, but we were able to find workarounds and restore Buildbot testing.</li>\n<li>We are nearing completion on a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/website/issues/4\">replacement for BeeWare's website</a>. The new website will use the same MkDocs infrastructure that is used for our tutorial and project documentation. This will add dark mode, search capabilities, improved event and resources pages, and some other content simplifications to our website. It will also make our job easier as maintainers, as website builds are much faster, and adding new content to the site is easier.</li>\n<li>We released <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/releases\">updated Apple support packages</a> for all supported Python versions. These updated versions are the first to adopt the XCFramework layout that has been accepted upstream by CPython, including scripts for managing the process of processing binary libraries on iOS.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2639\">reset all runtime permissions when running an app on Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We added <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2636\">the ability to merge folders named in <code>sources</code> and <code>test_sources</code> in a Briefcase configuration</a>. This allows projects to overlay platform-specific content over a base project layout.</li>\n<li>We added the ability for Windows MSI installers to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2638\">reference the location of the original MSI in post-install scripts</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2627\">improved our documentation of the use of signing identities</a>.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2651\">open a single Briefcase app in a project that contains multiple app definitions</a>.</li>\n<li>We modified our System PySide library to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/system-pyside6/pull/12\">support some common KDE extensions</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected an issue with Toga Chart that <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga-chart/pull/310\">prevented the example app from running on Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected an issue with the <a href=\"https://github.com/dmgbuild/dmgbuild/pull/275\">handling of background images in DMGs on macOS Tahoe</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected some issues with parsing the <a href=\"https://github.com/dmgbuild/dmgbuild/pull/279\"><code>size</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/dmgbuild/dmgbuild/pull/276\"><code>text-size</code> properties</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/dmgbuild/dmgbuild/pull/277\">color hex regexes</a> when creating DMGs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Much of this work is due to the contributions of members of the BeeWare community.

More details about our first semester contributions can be found <a href=\"../2025-curtin-university-capstone-project---semester-end/\">in our first semester report</a>. After this, the team split off into pairs to plan out larger deliverable contributions that would add or changes features within BeeWare.</p>\n<p>It is these deliverables that the team worked on in the second semester.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-weve-worked-on-this-semester\">What We\u2019ve Worked On This Semester<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-weve-worked-on-this-semester\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"toga-web-testing\">Toga Web Testing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#toga-web-testing\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>This semester, we delivered a functional prototype of a testing mechanism for Toga\u2019s Web backend. This prototype addresses the problems identified in the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/3545\">analysis we performed during our first semester</a>. The problem was straightforward: there wasn\u2019t a practical, end-to-end way to run automated tests against Toga web apps running in the browser. Our prototype addresses this by introducing a structured communication bridge between the backend, and the frontend, widget proxies, and DOM probes. This enables end-to-end tests that tests both widget logic and rendered UI. At this stage, the work serves as a proof-of-concept approach rather than a finished product. It demonstrates that the core approach works reliably, though additional features and improvements remain to be implemented. Our proof-of-concept prototype can be found within our <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3728\">draft pull request</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"briefcase-web-development-optimizations\">Briefcase Web Development Optimizations<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#briefcase-web-development-optimizations\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>We also laid the groundwork for web platform development mode support in Briefcase by making the <code>dev</code> command platform-aware, and implementing virtual environment management. We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2419\">refactored the core <code>DevCommand</code> architecture</a> by introducing platform-specific <code>DevCommand</code> subclasses like <code>StaticWebDevCommand</code> to handle platform-dependent workflows). Next, we <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2420\">implemented virtual environment management</a> by introducing the <code>VirtualEnvironment</code> context manager tool, which provides isolated, configurable virtual environments for development mode, and <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2495\">improved the tracking of virtual environment usage by the dev command</a>. We also <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2498\">modified the handling of local Python assets</a> so they are installed in editable mode. This work establishes the foundation for exposing the app assets to a development web server allowing the live-reload workflow, ultimately speeding up the web development process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pyscript-briefcase-and-toga-dependencies\">PyScript Briefcase and Toga Dependencies<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#pyscript-briefcase-and-toga-dependencies\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Lastly, we worked on redesigning the Briefcase static web build pipeline to implement a deterministic asset insertion system which replaced template-based asset management. The new system enables Toga and other toolkits to embed their configuration files and front-end resources directly <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3666\">into wheel packages</a> which <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2442\">new Briefcase functionality</a> will extract and insert into static web files. The <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-web-static-template/pull/21\">web template received a redesign</a> which established specific areas for insertion. The <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2337\">previous restrictions</a> prevented Toga and other toolkits from taking full control of their front-end operations while working independently from Briefcase. The new system separates tasks while making maintenance easier and enables toolkits to manage their front-end components, with Toga now owning its own PyScript version, PyScript configuration and Shoelace HTML script.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#lessons-learned\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This year with BeeWare has marked many valuable lessons taught outside of the class environment. Each of us have now made significant contributions to an Open Source project while meeting deadlines and attending weekly stand-up meetings. This process has allowed us to develop our skills in numerous ways. Below each of us will comment our individual lessons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kavidu\"><nospell>Kavidu</nospell><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#kavidu\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Working with BeeWare was my first professional experience outside of university. This was a huge opportunity for me to have hands-on exposure to real-world software development work within Open Source environments. I gained experience working with large community-based codebases through issue tracking and pull request management while teaming up with developers who used different time zones and technical expertise.</p>\n<p>The experience helped me develop better abilities to work with others while improving my skills in team collaboration. The combination of weekly stand-ups and code reviews and asynchronous teamwork helped me develop skills to explain technical concepts simply and receive feedback positively while creating code that others could understand and expand. I developed better skills in Python programming, testing and I learned to create testable code that other developers could use to extend the project.</p>\n<p>Moreover, working with BeeWare provided me with essential knowledge about Open Source software engineering through its combination of technical and collaborative aspects. Throughout the process, I learned that the development of good software requires designers to create intentional systems while they must communicate effectively to build tools which enable others to continue improving the project after their contribution ends.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mitchell\">Mitchell<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#mitchell\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>One of the most valuable lessons from BeeWare came while implementing a virtual environment context manager for Briefcase.</p>\n<p>During the planning and initial development, I was too focused on how this would work for the web development platform rather than on the actual design of the tool itself. My supervisor pointed out that this PR had applications in other areas within Briefcase and should be designed with those considerations in mind.</p>\n<p>I had been thinking in terms of \"what does the web platform need?\" when I should have been asking \"what capability does the system need?\" This misunderstanding affected my initial timeline and resulted in a much longer development cycle than intended, but it taught me something far more valuable. The real insight was that development shouldn't be task-specific but tool-specific.</p>\n<p>When working on something, it's not about what works for today's problem but what tool you're building that will work for any problem that emerges tomorrow. Good design means separating mechanism from policy: your tool provides the <em>how</em>, and each caller decides the <em>where</em>, <em>when</em>, and <em>why</em>. The goal isn't to predict every use case but to build tools that others can use as-is, without modification.</p>\n<p>When someone needs virtual environment management six months from now in a completely different context, they shouldn't have to change your code\u2014they should just be able to call it with their parameters and move on. Build it once so it works everywhere, not once per use case.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the best code is not the code that works today but rather the code that's still working unchanged a year from now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"veronica\">Veronica<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#veronica\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>As this was my first experience contributing to a large, Open Source project, I learned how the workflow fits together\u2014navigating existing code, writing clear issues and PRs, and contributing changes with clear commits and messages. I also learned to keep my work visible, pushing incremental changes, even when not fully finished, with clear notes on status and next steps so reviewers can follow my progress. That was a shift for me, as I used to wait for \u201cfinished\u201d work before committing.</p>\n<p>Regular stand-ups, shared planning, and pairing on tasks taught me how to work effectively in a team. Through this, I developed stronger communication and collaboration skills and gained a better understanding of how individual contributions fit within a larger shared goal, especially when it comes to coding workflows.</p>\n<p>I've improved my Python skills and gained real experience with <code>pytest</code> and Playwright while working on the Toga Web Testing prototype. Most importantly, I learned how to design a cross-process system that bridges a <code>pytest</code> test runner to an app running in the browser, which gave me a much deeper understanding of both testing frameworks and web automation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jaeden\"><nospell>Jaeden</nospell><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#jaeden\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Beginning with limited Python knowledge increased the learning curve for me however by reflecting at the end of this journey I can see the difference in skills I have gained. I am more confident and familiar now working on a project alongside other software engineers discussing ideas whilst maintaining professional communication practices via weekly stand-up calls and email. Working on Briefcase has taught me to simplify my code more. After regular code reviews from Russell, I realized my code was always more complicated than necessary and could often be simplified either by using in built Python functions or functions already defined somewhere in the codebase that I wasn't aware of.</p>\n<h3 id=\"callum\"><nospell>Callum</nospell><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#callum\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Throughout this project, I learned that effective communication is one of the most important aspects of collaborative software development. Working on the same codebase as others required constant coordination to prevent overlap and ensure our work aligned technically and conceptually. Regular discussions and updates helped us avoid duplicated effort and made it easier to maintain a shared understanding of the project\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>I learned that transparency, even when work is still in progress, is far more valuable than delaying updates. This also ties closely to the importance of maintaining visibility in an Open Source context, where an up-to-date and traceable history of commits allows others to easily follow development and provide frequent, relevant feedback. Consistently sharing progress, even in small increments, made collaboration far more effective.</p>\n<p>Finally, I learned the importance of handover reports and how essential they are for communicating the current state and future direction of a project. A well-written handover report provides clarity on what has been implemented, what has not worked as intended, and what areas require further development or refactoring. It also serves as a bridge for future contributors, ensuring that knowledge is not lost and that others can continue the work without repeating past mistakes. Through this process, I came to appreciate that clear documentation at the end of a project is just as valuable as the technical work itself, as it enables continuity and long-term maintainability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"caydn\"><nospell>Caydn</nospell><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#caydn\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>This year has taught me how to work effectively within both a small team and a large Open Source project. It's been very eye opening navigating the expectations and workflows that come with contributing to a community-driven codebase. During the first semester, I found that I didn't know how much to push or when to create a PR. This meant that Russell couldn't perceive work being completed and that I could not receive help in situations where I was stuck. With our semester 2 work, especially as we were working in pairs, I made it a goal to commit and push any slight change. This drastically improved our collaboration efforts.</p>\n<p>I've also gained confidence and appreciation for modular architecture through working on the PyScript insertion system. Previously, having only worked on smaller codebases of my own or for group assignment work, I've never truly worked on multiple systems that would interact with each other. Having spent time reconfiguring dependencies within BeeWare, I've now learned the value of planning and researching before implementation. The untangling of Toga and the Static Web Template has been some of the most fun I've had within programming thus far. I'm looking forward to seeing how BeeWare continues to make use of and expand on this system.</p>\n<p>Collaborative feedback and reviews from Russell, Malcolm, and the team, especially <nospell>Kavidu</nospell> have undoubtedly improved our code quality and allowed me to grow as a software engineer. While initially scary to have frequent check ins with my code, I've now placed much more importance in these reviews. Not only does it allow you to gain insight into what may be going wrong, but more experienced developers tend to impart their wisdom upon you. For me, this now means I pay much closer attention to deep indentation as well as the readability and traceability of my written code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-work\">Future work<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#future-work\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>While we have delivered significant changes within the BeeWare ecosystem, continued efforts will be required to complete our works. Each deliverable varies in terms of remaining tasks.</p>\n<p>The Toga Web Testing prototype provides a strong foundation for a complete testing framework but remains at a proof-of-concept stage. Future work will focus on extending test coverage across more widgets, stabilizing the proxy and <nospell>RPC</nospell> systems and integration with Briefcase to enable a unified startup process for web tests. More details on the current implementation and next steps can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/3545#issuecomment-3425284525\">Toga Web Testing Handover Report</a>.</p>\n<p>The <code>briefcase dev</code> command now has the basic foundations to support a true development workflow for web applications, enabling live-editing and hot-reload without requiring wheel builds. The remaining work focuses on implementing a parser to locate editable source code paths from <code>.pth</code> files, creating symlinks or file copies in the web project\u2019s static directory so PyScript can load modules directly from local source files, generating the necessary HTML and PyScript configuration to run these modules in the browser, and integrating the development server to bring all these components together. Once completed, these enhancements will enable developers to modify Python source files and instantly see their changes reflected in the browser.

Going forward, you can expect that BeeWare's quarterly plans will be published a couple of weeks into the quarter.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"q3-progress\">Q3 progress<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q3-progress\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The end of Q3 sees the release of a new Python version - 3.14. The 3.14 release contains official Android binary artefacts, and a number of improvements to the iOS build process that will lead to official iOS binary artefacts, hopefully in the near future. It also contains restored support for Emscripten as a Tier 3 supported platform. Landing these improvements in 3.14, and ensuring that the BeeWare ecosystem is in a position to use those changes, was a subject of considerable effort in Q3. We were also forced to respond to a number of significant changes to the GitHub Actions macOS ecosystem - work that is ongoing as a side effect of macOS 26 changes and the deprecation of Intel as a supported macOS platform.</p>\n<p>We continued to make progress on the state of binary packaging for iOS and Android. <code>cibuildwheel</code> 3.1 included support for Android that we contributed; as a result, it is now possible for projects to have CI pipelines that generate both iOS and Android wheels. We now have a <a href=\"https://beeware.org/mobile-wheels/\">leaderboard of mobile wheel support in Python</a>, and we're starting to see others in the Python community contribute iOS and Android support updates to popular Python projects. We've also been able to consolidate some of the work that we've done on establishing cross-platform environments into a single standalone package - <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/xbuild/\"><code>xbuild</code></a> - that can be used to replicate the functionality that <code>cibuildwheel</code> relies on for cross-platform builds.</p>\n<p>We made many improvements in Briefcase's Windows installer support. This began with migrating to a current version of WiX, which then allowed us to add several new features, including displaying a license agreement, offering installation options, and running custom installer and uninstaller scripts.</p>\n<p>BeeWare's documentation has also seen some significant improvements. Building on the improvements to the website, we've been able to begin switching our documentation from using reStructuredText to Markdown. reStructuredText is a markup standard that is historically significant in the Python community, but sees very little use elsewhere. It's clear that the rest of the online world has adopted Markdown, and Markdown is also significantly simpler as a syntax; we're hoping that these two factors should make it easier for new contributors to get involved in BeeWare development, and simplify some documentation tasks for BeeWare maintainers. We've already ported many of our READMEs, our tutorial, and Toga's documentation to Markdown format, with more changes to come.</p>\n<p>Our students from Curtin University have almost concluded their capstone projects. As a result, Briefcase now has significantly improved deployment options for web-based projects, and the foundations for some significant improvements to how Briefcase uses virtual environments are in place. Although our students will be signing off shortly, we expect to be able to deliver some substantial improvements to Briefcase using these features in the coming quarter.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we had a successful attendance at EuroPython, PyCon AU, and PyCon UK, presenting multiple talks, tutorials, and introducing a large number of people to Open Source contribution through the sprints. We also attended the Python Core Team sprint, providing a great opportunity to finalize some details in the 3.14 release, and discuss our plans for the upcoming 3.15 release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"q4-priorities\">Q4 priorities<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q4-priorities\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Q4, we're hoping to make one final push on binary packaging for mobile platforms. In addition to wrapping up work on some of the more notable scientific Python packages (such as NumPy and Pandas), we intend to look into packages that are built using Rust. Rust is becoming an increasingly important part of the Python binary ecosystem, and Rust already has support for iOS and Android. However, we need to make sure that Python/Rust tools like Maturin are able to support cross compilation.</p>\n<p>We also want to wrap up our work getting iOS binary artefacts as part of the CPython release process, and work on getting those artefacts into use with Briefcase. This will require some improvements to Briefcase, making use of the <code>xbuild</code> package, and the work contributed by our Curtin University students.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longer-term-goals\">Longer term goals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#longer-term-goals\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Looking to 2026, after 2 years of building a foundation for a stable, officially supported story for Python on mobile, we can turn our attention back to the apps that people build with BeeWare. This will mean filling some functionality gaps in Toga to satisfy some common app requirements, and writing more documentation and tutorials to help people write apps with BeeWare's tools.</p>\n<p>We're also expecting that 2026 will see more integration between BeeWare's tools and other packaging tools. We're already exploring ways that Briefcase can integrate better with Conda. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase development story, and some of the changes landed by our Curtin students make exploring these options much easier.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-28T05:06:04.854122+00:00", "date_published": "2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "russell@beeware.org (Russell Keith-Magee)"}], "tags": ["Buzz"]}, {"id": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/september-2025-status-update/", "url": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/september-2025-status-update/", "title": "September 2025 Status Update", "content_html": "<p>September has been a busy month for conference travel, but we've also managed to make some important improvements to projects in the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"what-weve-done\">What we've done<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-weve-done\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We attended <a href=\"https://2025.pycon.org.au\">PyCon AU</a>, giving a presentation about the process of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytlbiDF0Ba4\">creating Android and iOS wheels</a>.</li>\n<li>We attended the CPython core team summit at the ARM campus in Cambridge, UK.

This will significantly reduce the likelihood of bugs landing in main that will break the Android buildbots.</li>\n<li>We spent a significant amount of time <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/12777\">dealing with an update to GitHub Actions</a>. On August 11, GitHub rolled out an update to the disk image they use for macOS 15 machines - and in the process, broke the tools that BeeWare uses to test iOS applications. It took almost a week to identify the cause of this problem, and develop a fix. However, the good news is that <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138018\">the fix significantly simplifies the iOS testing process</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138176\">began the process of adding official Python binaries for iOS</a>. The complexity of iOS multi-architecture builds makes official builds a little more complicated than Android, but we're hopeful this work will be able to land in the near future.</li>\n<li>We added a recipe for building <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps/pull/64\">iOS binaries for <code>zstandard</code></a>.

This change allows us to simplify the contents of the support packages.</li>\n<li>We made Briefcase <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2429\">more resilient to badly packaged binary wheels on macOS</a>. Many packages publish <code>py3-none-any</code> wheels, which <em>should</em> be platform independent - but then include platform-specific binaries or dynamic library content in the wheels. Briefcase will now ignore these files.</li>\n<li>Briefcase's unit tests have been made <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2434\">more resilient to temporary network outages</a> - something that happens surprisingly often in the GitHub Actions environment.</li>\n<li>We dropped support for Python 3.9, and added support for Python 3.14 across BeeWare projects. For the first time, this includes the ability to release Windows support <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2432\">based on pre-releases of Python</a> - previously, we had to wait until the <code>.0</code> release of a new Python version before we could add support.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3683\">improved the checks (and error reporting) associated with using new versions of Travertino with old versions of Toga</a>.</li>\n<li>We resolved a long standing bug on iOS where <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3680\">touch events wouldn't be triggered if content was \"below the fold\" on a scroll container</a>.</li>\n<li>We started work on a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/xbuild\">new tool to consolidate the cross-platform building tools used on Android, iOS and Emscripten</a>.

We're still waiting on a formal release of meson and meson-python that includes the iOS changes that we provided; once those releases occur, we'll be able to submit patches for even more projects. We also continued to work on supporting Android in <code>cibuildwheel</code>. This work is still in the review phase; we're hoping it will be concluded in the near future.</p>\n<p>A CPython buildbot for Emscripten is now live. The process of launching this buildbot revealed a number of bugs that required resolution; a small number of bugs still remain. We don't anticipate any issue resolving these before the 3.14.0 final release. The draft PEPs defining the Emscripten platform (PEP 776) and Emscripten wheel tagging (PEP 783) have not seen any major progress.</p>\n<p>Our students from Curtin University have concluded their first semester of work, providing implementations for a range of Toga widgets on the web platform, finding (and resolving) a number of bugs along the way. They've also made a number of small improvements to Briefcase. As part of their work, they've laid out plans for more substantial contributions in the second half of the year. These contributions should result in significant improvements to the development experience for Toga's web backend.</p>\n<p>We also saw a lot of unexpected improvements in BeeWare's documentation and website. We now have a much improved translation infrastructure for BeeWare's website. A significant review of the structure of the documentation of the major BeeWare projects is also underway, addressing both visual consistency, and the integration of the documentation projects into the overall web presence of the BeeWare project.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we had a successful PyCon US attendance, presenting multiple talks, a tutorials, and introducing a large number of people to Open Source contribution through the sprints.</p>\n<h2 id=\"q3-priorities\">Q3 priorities<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q3-priorities\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Q3, we will have two major areas of focus for BeeWare development.</p>\n<p>The first, unsurprisingly, is to continue working on binary packaging. We'll continue working on the <code>cibuildwheel</code> patch to support building Android wheels; and we'll continue the process of submitting patches for iOS support to notable packages. Some of this work is dependent on formal releases of meson and meson-python; we'll progress as fast as the published state of the ecosystem allows.</p>\n<p>The second area of focus is generating iOS and Android binary artefacts as part of the CPython release process. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which should limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>We'll also be attending EuroPython in July; PyCon AU, CPython core team summit and PyCon UK in September. These are important events for community outreach and for collaboration with other projects and the core team - but they'll obviously place constraints on the progress we make in the quarter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longer-term-goals\">Longer term goals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#longer-term-goals\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The long term goals of BeeWare remain largely the same. Once we've developed a compelling story for mobile binary packaging, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga. There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare support channels. Unless pull requests are submitted from the broader community, it is unlikely that we'll make any substantial progress on this front until the end of this year, or perhaps early next year.</p>\n<p>We're also intending to look at tooling other than <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> for building Briefcase packages. Integration with Conda is one obvious goal, as it provides rich tooling for distributing complex binary requirements. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase development story. Again, it is unlikely that we'll make any progress on this front before the end of this year.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-28T05:06:04.848002+00:00", "date_published": "2025-07-02T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "russell@beeware.org (Russell Keith-Magee)"}], "tags": ["Buzz"]}, {"id": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/june-2025-status-update/", "url": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/june-2025-status-update/", "title": "June 2025 Status Update", "content_html": "<p>June has been a busy month, with some big improvements to BeeWare's websites and documentation, and some major milestones reached in our work on mobile packaging.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"what-weve-done\">What we've done<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-weve-done\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/cibuildwheel/3.0.0/\"><code>cibuildwheel</code> 3.0</a> has been released - including iOS support!

The web platform is incompatible with this as WebAssembly does not support multithreading. To address this, we are working on developing a general approach that allows the test suite and testbed app to run in separate processes. This will include using proxy objects in place of Toga objects in the test suite that will wrap the respective object in the testbed app, forwarding commands to it in order to change its state and retrieve data.</p>\n<p>Additionally, to verify the rendered state of the testbed app, we plan to use Playwright to inspect the browser's DOM and compare it against what the test suite expects.

This issue was resolved separately but sparked broader discussions about the ownership of PyScript, Shoelace, and Bootstrap within the wider BeeWare architecture. Currently, the Briefcase web template includes these directly in <code>index.html</code>, but they should ideally be managed as dependencies of Toga.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re proposing to shift ownership of these dependencies to Toga and other toolkits, enabling them to define their own configurations and inserts while keeping Briefcase focused purely on packaging. This would allow for clearer version control, better modularity, and easier maintenance across the ecosystem. This approach builds on prior work (<a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1285\">briefcase#1285</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1945\">toga#1945</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-web-static-template/pull/9\">briefcase-web-static-template#9</a>) and introduces a mechanism for toolkit-managed inserts and configuration.

Many of the contributions described in this blog post come from PyCon US contributions.</li>\n<li>Our proposed changes to <a href=\"https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/14541\">Meson</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/731\">Meson-python</a> have all been accepted, and will be included in the next releases of those tools. There have been some other conversations with the Meson team that have led to some minor improvements in the features added to support mobile binary packaging.</li>\n<li>We made a major set of updates to the BeeWare website, <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/629\">transitioning all the content to Markdown</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/637\">moving the translation infrastructure to Weblate</a>.</li>\n<li>We modified the Briefcase new project wizard to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2271\">draw default values from a user's Git configuration, where possible</a></li>\n<li>We modified Briefcase's handling of licenses to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2272\">use SPDX standard abbreviations</a></li>\n<li>We optimized the handling of signing on macOS to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2302\">remove a redundant ad hoc signing pass when packaging an app</a></li>\n<li>We improved <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2305\">warnings for users who have an old version of Python</a>, which would result in them having an old version of Briefcase, but be unaware of this fact.</li>\n<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2308\">use the system certificate store</a>. This should remove a very common source of errors on some corporate-managed VPNs. We also improved error handling to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2318\">provide more context for any remaining SSL or related connection errors</a>.</li>\n<li>We improved error messages when <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2303\">one of the required wheels can't be found on iOS and macOS</a></li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3472\">corrected the events that are generated by Tables on Windows</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3471\">improved the error handling when an app doesn't return valid window content as part of its startup method</a></li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3467\">added a mechanism for detecting dark mode on Android</a></li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3359\">significantly improved the handling of type annotations</a>, allowing for Toga's lazy loading main module.</li>\n<li>We made some modifications to the <code>WebView</code> widget, <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3400\">adding support for setting content at time of construction</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3401\">simplifying the interface for setting static content</a></li>\n<li>Our student contributors have continued to work on Toga's web backend. They've added new <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3405\"><code>TimeInput</code></a> widget, and they've begun planning some larger contributions to Briefcase and Toga to improve the tools for testing the Web backend. There should be a blog post in a couple of weeks that details their plans for the remainder of the year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's next?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-next\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>For most this year, we've been trying to get the pieces in place to support binary packaging on mobile platforms. We're now at a point where the code required to support iOS is mostly in place; and the code to support Android is <em>almost</em> in place; however, it will be difficult to make further progress until those changes are available in public releases.</p>\n<p>So, in June, we'll be changing focus. We're aiming to take a look at Briefcase, with 2 major improvements in mind. Firstly, we want to upgrade our Windows packaging story, and upgrade our WiX support from WiX 3 to a current version. This should resolve some issues with packaging large apps and apps with lots of files; it should also enable us to package applications for ARM64. Secondly, we've had some requests to expose Briefcase's packaging and signing infrastructure so it can be used on projects that <em>aren't</em> built with Briefcase - we're hoping to add this as well.</p>\n<p>We're also hoping to follow up on some of our discussion with the Python core team at PyCon, and begin the process of integrating the production of iOS and Android binary artefacts into Python releases. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which will hopefully limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support. Last month, we thought we were one issue away from a working buildbot; however, some new issues have emerged since then. We still hope to have a working buildbot before 3.14 is finalized, which will restore Emscripten to Tier 3 status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-get-involved\">Want to get involved?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#want-to-get-involved\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Want to get involved?

PyPI now accepts binary wheel uploads; and we have uploaded wheels for one package (<code>pyspamsum</code>) to prove that this support works. We've also contributed changes in <code>cibuildwheel</code> that supports the creation of iOS binary wheels. We need to wait until those changes are in an official <code>cibuildwheel</code> release before we can contribute patches upstream for other projects, but we have patches for a couple of projects ready to submit as soon as there is an official release to use. We've completed some preparatory work in CPython and pip to support building Android binary wheels, but the changes to <code>cibuildwheel</code> to support Android wheels are still in the early stages of development.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our collaboration with the PyScript team didn't work out as expected; the opportunity to work with the PyScript team that we anticipated did not eventuate. However, a group of students from Curtin University will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their final year capstone project. This will include making modifications to Briefcase to support testing web-based apps. This project will run until the end of the year; we look forward to seeing the progress they're able to make.</p>\n<p>However, we <em>have</em> made good progress on Emscripten support in CPython. A buildbot for Emscripten is almost ready to launch; having a stable buildbot is a major milestone in restoring Emscripten to Tier 3 support in CPython. Draft PEPs defining the Emscripten platform (PEP 776) and Emscripten wheel tagging (PEP 783) are currently in discussion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"q2-priorities\">Q2 priorities<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q2-priorities\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Q2, we're planning to continue working on binary packaging for mobile platforms. This work will take three forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We'll continue working on the <code>cibuildwheel</code> patch to support building Android wheels. Now that the iOS patch has landed in <code>cibuildwheel</code>, we're in a position to use that patch as a template for the analogous changes needed to support Android.</li>\n<li>We'll continue to work on generating patches to third-party projects to prove that the tooling we've developed for mobile binary wheels is sufficient to support the entire Python ecosystem. We're currently working on NumPy; Cryptography will likely be the next project we look into.</li>\n<li>We will start the process of formalizing and standardizing the work that we've done to support iOS and Android packaging. With PyCon US approaching rapidly, we want to get these discussions underway so that we can make the most of the opportunity provided by having a large portion of the Python community in one place. There are two major areas that require formalization - the production of official binaries for iOS and Android support; and the state of cross-platform build environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the work we're doing on mobile binary wheels, we're expecting to work on improving Briefcase, with a view to making Briefcase's tooling for packaging, signing and notarization useful as standalone utilities, without the need to use Briefcase to package the entire app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longer-term-goals\">Longer term goals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#longer-term-goals\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The long term goals of BeeWare remain largely the same. Once we've developed a compelling story for mobile binary packaging, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga. There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare support channels. Unless pull requests are submitted from the broader community, it is unlikely that we'll make any substantial progress on this front until the end of this year, or perhaps early next year.</p>\n<p>We're also intending to look at tooling other than <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> for building Briefcase packages. Integration with Conda is one obvious goal, as it provides rich tooling for distributing complex binary requirements. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase development story. Again, it is unlikely that we'll make any progress on this front before the end of this year.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-28T05:06:04.842795+00:00", "date_published": "2025-04-03T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "russell@beeware.org (Russell Keith-Magee)"}], "tags": ["Buzz"]}, {"id": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/march-2025-status-update/", "url": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/march-2025-status-update/", "title": "March 2025 Status Update", "content_html": "<p>March has seen a big release for Toga, and a number of other notable improvements in the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"what-weve-done\">What we've done<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-weve-done\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.5.0/\">Toga 0.5.0 has been released</a>! It's been over 5 months since our last feature release of Toga; this release includes a number of major improvements to Toga's style layer, and some significant improvements in iOS and macOS memory handling. This release includes a number of backwards incompatible changes; check the <a href=\"https://toga.beeware.org/en/stable/about/releases/#backward-incompatible-changes_3\">Toga 0.5.0 release notes</a> for details.</li>\n<li>We added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3114\">Toga-Positron bootstrap</a>. This bootstrap is a Briefcase plugin that provides an easy way to start a new project that uses a web browser as the primary UI. This is effectively the equivalent of Electron-style apps - but the code is entirely written in Python, and works on iOS and Android. It also allows for hybrid apps: as the underlying app is a Toga app, you can mix Toga widgets into the layout that is being used. The bootstrap allows you to convert a Django website or static web server into a mobile app; it also provides a way to generate a \"single site browser\" - converting a single public URL into a standalone app on your desktop.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3273\">modified the way that style properties are applied to Toga widgets</a>. Style updates are now applied in batch updates, dramatically reducing the amount of repeated work required when changing the appearance of a widget.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3293\">improved the UX of the WinForms Table widget</a>, ensuring that the selected row is still visible when a table doesn't have focus.</li>\n<li>We improved Toga's <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3270\">handling of the <code>asyncio</code> event loop on Windows</a>. This change ensures that WinForms apps always clean up the event loop on exit; previously, it was possible for warnings to be raised on application exit, caused by open sockets and <nospell>un-<code>await</code>ed</nospell> co-routines.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3268\">modified the handling of alignment style properties</a> to ensure that when text <em>direction</em> is changed, the layout of the app is re-evaluated.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3217\">added support for controlling inter-line spacing in multi-line text on a canvas</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3118\">corrected some issues with background color handling on Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3256\">corrected some issues with supporting PyGObject on Linux distributions that are based on Debian 12 (including Ubuntu 22.04)</a>.

With this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS with a single command: <code>CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</code>. This PR then <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2337\">required a follow-up investigation and fix</a> to correct an intermittent issue that was seen when running the <code>cibuildwheel</code> tests in CI.</li>\n<li>We've started work on a follow-up PR to <code>cibuildwheel</code>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2317\">adding support for explicitly declaring safe cross-build tools</a>.

In addition to finishing the work on the \"safe cross-build tools\" patch, we will continue to work on porting \"real world\" packages (like NumPy) to discover any gaps that exist in the mobile packaging story. During April, we also hope to submit a PR to support Android in <code>cibuildwheel</code>; and to start a discussion with the rest of the Python packaging community about the use of cross-platform build environments.</p>\n<p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten buildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to resolve, and then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython buildbot fleet.</p>\n<p>There's also good news for Toga's Web backend - a group of students from Curtin University will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their final year capstone project. This will include making modifications to Briefcase to support testing web-based apps. Some of the improvements to Toga and Briefcase that landed this month are the result of those students becoming familiar with BeeWare's contribution process. This project will run until the end of the year; we look forward to seeing the progress they're able to make.</p>\n<p>Looking a little further ahead - in May, we'll be attending PyCon US! We're presenting a <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/78/\">talk</a> and a <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/147/\">tutorial</a>; and we'll be there for the first 3 days of the sprints. We'll have a presence at the Anaconda booth in the main hall; we'll be attending other events (such as the language summit) during the conference; and we're hoping to plan some open spaces. Ticket sales are open - we hope to see you there!</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-get-involved\">Want to get involved?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#want-to-get-involved\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Want to get involved?
