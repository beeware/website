This is part of a larger set of changes cleaning up the implementation of <code>Canvas</code>.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4047\">add a bitmap image on a <code>Canvas</code></a>.</li>\n<li>We made a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4042\">large internal refactor of the <code>Table</code> and <code>Tree</code> widgets</a>. This is the first step in improving the API for defining <code>Table</code> and <code>Tree</code> widgets to exposed some long-needed capabilities like sorting and specifying column widths.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4138\">hardened the definition for providing icons in <code>Table</code> and <code>Tree</code> column data</a>. The documented API has been specific for some time, but hasn't been implemented consistently on all platforms.</li>\n<li>We modified the way Source objects are used to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4032\">ensure that widgets no longer listen to stale sources when data changes</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4063\">formalized the protocol definitions for data source listeners</a></li>\n<li>We corrected some issues with the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4010\">display of <code>OptionContainer</code>s on Cocoa and GTK when content is changed on a non-visible tab</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected a number of <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4043\">layout issues on iOS and iPad apps</a>, including introducing the ability for iPad apps to operate in non-full screen mode.</li>\n<li>We corrected some issues with <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4034\">scroll handling in <code>ScrollContainer</code> on macOS</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected some issues with <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4099\">widget colors in dark mode on macOS</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected some <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4016\">memory leak issues with Android widgets</a>.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4026\">use the Python standard library <code>webbrowser</code> module in Toga Android apps</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected the use of <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3751\">theme colors in <code>DetailedList</code> on Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to be <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4036\">notified when a website completes loading on Android</a>. This API feature was previously possible on every platform <em>except</em> Android.</li>\n<li>We corrected the handling of <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4051\">icon sizes on buttons on Windows</a></li>\n<li>We simplified the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4022\">categories used in Toga's API reference docs</a>.</li>\n<li>We clarified the documentation around <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4065\">using Toga with a Python version other than the system default</a>.</li>\n<li>We added documentation of Toga's <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4079\">platform and backend selection APIs</a>.</li>\n<li>We ensured that content added to an <code>OptionContainer</code> or <code>SplitContainer</code> can <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/4113\">accurately track the Window and App they are associated with</a>.</li>\n<li>We completed work on patches to NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn and xgboost allowing these projects to be built for Android. This also involved updates to tools including <code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>auditwheel</code>, Meson, and Python's own Android testbed. We hope to upstream these patches to the corresponding projects in the near future.</li>\n<li>We resolved an issue with <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/144315\">Android buildbot testing in CPython</a>. Both Android Buildbots stopped working in mid December for two different reasons; the cause of the problems is not entirely understood, but we were able to find workarounds and restore Buildbot testing.</li>\n<li>We are nearing completion on a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/website/issues/4\">replacement for BeeWare's website</a>. The new website will use the same MkDocs infrastructure that is used for our tutorial and project documentation. This will add dark mode, search capabilities, improved event and resources pages, and some other content simplifications to our website. It will also make our job easier as maintainers, as website builds are much faster, and adding new content to the site is easier.</li>\n<li>We released <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/releases\">updated Apple support packages</a> for all supported Python versions. These updated versions are the first to adopt the XCFramework layout that has been accepted upstream by CPython, including scripts for managing the process of processing binary libraries on iOS.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2639\">reset all runtime permissions when running an app on Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We added <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2636\">the ability to merge folders named in <code>sources</code> and <code>test_sources</code> in a Briefcase configuration</a>. This allows projects to overlay platform-specific content over a base project layout.</li>\n<li>We added the ability for Windows MSI installers to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2638\">reference the location of the original MSI in post-install scripts</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2627\">improved our documentation of the use of signing identities</a>.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2651\">open a single Briefcase app in a project that contains multiple app definitions</a>.</li>\n<li>We modified our System PySide library to <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/system-pyside6/pull/12\">support some common KDE extensions</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected an issue with Toga Chart that <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga-chart/pull/310\">prevented the example app from running on Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected an issue with the <a href=\"https://github.com/dmgbuild/dmgbuild/pull/275\">handling of background images in DMGs on macOS Tahoe</a>.</li>\n<li>We corrected some issues with parsing the <a href=\"https://github.com/dmgbuild/dmgbuild/pull/279\"><code>size</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/dmgbuild/dmgbuild/pull/276\"><code>text-size</code> properties</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/dmgbuild/dmgbuild/pull/277\">color hex regexes</a> when creating DMGs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Much of this work is due to the contributions of members of the BeeWare community.

This is also an important step towards adding iOS builds to Python's CI matrix, and towards producing iOS binary artefacts as part of the CPython release process.</li>\n<li>We added code to CPython that handles <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/139163\">Apple's recently announced requirement for Privacy Manifests</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138649\">updated CPython's Android CI</a> to use the same set of test options as the other platforms.</li>\n<li>We contributed changes to CMake <a href=\"https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests/11153\">improving the handling of Android Python modules</a>.</li>\n<li>We added an <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3729\"><code>ActivityIndicator</code> widget for Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3581\">improved the size hinting of <code>DateInput</code> and <code>TimeInput</code> widgets on iOS</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3768\">enabled focus handling on Table and Tree widgets on desktop platforms</a>.</li>\n<li>We investigated a number of reported issues relating to the macOS and iOS 26 releases, the rollout of the new \"Liquid Glass\" style, and what BeeWare needs to do in order to comply with this new style.</li>\n<li>We continued to make progress on migrating BeeWare's documentation to use Markdown, instead of Restructured Text. A lot of the effort over the last month has related to translation tooling; but we're almost ready to switch the BeeWare tutorial over to the Markdown version. We've also made some progress on migrating Toga's documentation to Markdown. This is a much bigger project as it involves API documentation, and much more complex cross-linking relationships.</li>\n<li>We performed some initial investigations into post-install and pre-uninstall scripting on Windows.

We're now at a point where the code required to support iOS is mostly in place; and the code to support Android is <em>almost</em> in place; however, it will be difficult to make further progress until those changes are available in public releases.</p>\n<p>So, in June, we'll be changing focus. We're aiming to take a look at Briefcase, with 2 major improvements in mind. Firstly, we want to upgrade our Windows packaging story, and upgrade our WiX support from WiX 3 to a current version. This should resolve some issues with packaging large apps and apps with lots of files; it should also enable us to package applications for ARM64. Secondly, we've had some requests to expose Briefcase's packaging and signing infrastructure so it can be used on projects that <em>aren't</em> built with Briefcase - we're hoping to add this as well.</p>\n<p>We're also hoping to follow up on some of our discussion with the Python core team at PyCon, and begin the process of integrating the production of iOS and Android binary artefacts into Python releases. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which will hopefully limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support. Last month, we thought we were one issue away from a working buildbot; however, some new issues have emerged since then. We still hope to have a working buildbot before 3.14 is finalized, which will restore Emscripten to Tier 3 status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-get-involved\">Want to get involved?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#want-to-get-involved\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Want to get involved?

It's been over 5 months since our last feature release of Toga; this release includes a number of major improvements to Toga's style layer, and some significant improvements in iOS and macOS memory handling. This release includes a number of backwards incompatible changes; check the <a href=\"https://toga.beeware.org/en/stable/about/releases/#backward-incompatible-changes_3\">Toga 0.5.0 release notes</a> for details.</li>\n<li>We added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3114\">Toga-Positron bootstrap</a>. This bootstrap is a Briefcase plugin that provides an easy way to start a new project that uses a web browser as the primary UI. This is effectively the equivalent of Electron-style apps - but the code is entirely written in Python, and works on iOS and Android. It also allows for hybrid apps: as the underlying app is a Toga app, you can mix Toga widgets into the layout that is being used. The bootstrap allows you to convert a Django website or static web server into a mobile app; it also provides a way to generate a \"single site browser\" - converting a single public URL into a standalone app on your desktop.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3273\">modified the way that style properties are applied to Toga widgets</a>. Style updates are now applied in batch updates, dramatically reducing the amount of repeated work required when changing the appearance of a widget.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3293\">improved the UX of the WinForms Table widget</a>, ensuring that the selected row is still visible when a table doesn't have focus.</li>\n<li>We improved Toga's <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3270\">handling of the <code>asyncio</code> event loop on Windows</a>. This change ensures that WinForms apps always clean up the event loop on exit; previously, it was possible for warnings to be raised on application exit, caused by open sockets and <nospell>un-<code>await</code>ed</nospell> co-routines.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3268\">modified the handling of alignment style properties</a> to ensure that when text <em>direction</em> is changed, the layout of the app is re-evaluated.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3217\">added support for controlling inter-line spacing in multi-line text on a canvas</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3118\">corrected some issues with background color handling on Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3256\">corrected some issues with supporting PyGObject on Linux distributions that are based on Debian 12 (including Ubuntu 22.04)</a>. This was necessary because of a backwards incompatible change introduced into the PyGObject 3.52.1 release; unfortunately, users of older Linux distributions may need to make some modifications to their projects.</li>\n<li>The pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2286\">adding iOS support to <code>cibuildwheel</code></a> has been merged. With this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS with a single command: <code>CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</code>. This PR then <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2337\">required a follow-up investigation and fix</a> to correct an intermittent issue that was seen when running the <code>cibuildwheel</code> tests in CI.</li>\n<li>We've started work on a follow-up PR to <code>cibuildwheel</code>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2317\">adding support for explicitly declaring safe cross-build tools</a>. This is a use case that was identified during the development of PR for iOS support.</li>\n<li>We corrected a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2212\">long standing issue with <code>PTH</code> file handling in Briefcase</a>.</li>\n<li>We added the ability to invoke <code>briefcase build</code> and <code>briefcase package</code> on <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2201\">a single application in a Briefcase project</a>.</li>\n<li>We began work on a patch to support generating iOS binary wheels for NumPy. This is a work in progress; we've got a set of patches that allows us to <em>compile</em> NumPy, but the test suite won't run yet.</li>\n<li>We created a process to make an official <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/131532\">binary release of Python for Android</a>, which should be available on python.org starting with Python 3.14. This will reduce duplicated effort across Python on Android tools, and ensure binary compatibility in the packaging ecosystem.</li>\n<li>We submitted pull requests adding Android support to <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/880\">packaging</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13303\">pip</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's next?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-next\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Binary packaging will continue to be an area of focus in April. In addition to finishing the work on the \"safe cross-build tools\" patch, we will continue to work on porting \"real world\" packages (like NumPy) to discover any gaps that exist in the mobile packaging story. During April, we also hope to submit a PR to support Android in <code>cibuildwheel</code>; and to start a discussion with the rest of the Python packaging community about the use of cross-platform build environments.</p>\n<p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten buildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to resolve, and then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython buildbot fleet.</p>\n<p>There's also good news for Toga's Web backend - a group of students from Curtin University will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their final year capstone project. This will include making modifications to Briefcase to support testing web-based apps. Some of the improvements to Toga and Briefcase that landed this month are the result of those students becoming familiar with BeeWare's contribution process. This project will run until the end of the year; we look forward to seeing the progress they're able to make.</p>\n<p>Looking a little further ahead - in May, we'll be attending PyCon US! We're presenting a <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/78/\">talk</a> and a <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/147/\">tutorial</a>; and we'll be there for the first 3 days of the sprints. We'll have a presence at the Anaconda booth in the main hall; we'll be attending other events (such as the language summit) during the conference; and we're hoping to plan some open spaces.

Work on <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2349\">adding Android support</a> is still underway.</li>\n<li>An <a href=\"https://buildbot.python.org/#/builders/1810\">Emscripten CPython buildbot is now live</a>! The buildbot is currently failing 2 tests; but having a buildbot <em>at all</em> is a major step towards restoring Tier-3 support, and will help detect regressions on Emscripten as a platform.</li>\n<li>We've started a big review of the structure of our documentation, with a view to resolving a number of inconsistencies between platforms. This review will also involve a visual refresh, making BeeWare docs have a style consistent with the homepage; and improvements to how the documentation for BeeWare's individual projects fit into the overall BeeWare website.</li>\n<li>We added <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2336\">iCloud detection to Briefcase</a>. iCloud Drive synchronization adds metadata to some folders that prevents signing infrastructure from working; this has been a recurring source of problems during tutorials.</li>\n<li>We massively <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2284\">improved file type associations for macOS</a>. Briefcase previously supported macOS file associations, but expressed some very specific opinions on how files would be used. With these new improvements, it should be possible to support almost any macOS file type association requirements that an application might have.</li>\n<li>We modified Briefcase so <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2333\">it can package, sign and notarize applications that weren't built with Briefcase</a>. We've spent a lot of time automating the processes for building installers, and for managing signing and notarization - and almost none of that work depends on using Briefcase to build the app being packaged. With these modifications, you can now point Briefcase at an app that was built with a different tool, and Briefcase will manage the packaging and signing that is required.</li>\n<li>We've started the process of <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2355\">upgrading Briefcase to use a newer version of WiX for Windows MSI packaging</a>.</li>\n<li>We added a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3527\">Slider widget to the Web backend</a>.</li>\n<li>We added a <code>DateInput</code> widget to the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3483\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3574\">macOS</a> backends.</li>\n<li>We added a <code>TimeInput</code> widget to the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3536\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3574\">macOS</a> backends.</li>\n<li>We added an <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3473\"><code>ActivityIndicator</code> widget to the WinForms backend</a>.</li>\n<li>We modified the handling of Toga app paths so that <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3543\">requesting a path guarantees that it exists</a>. This is a significant improvement to user experience, as it's no longer necessary to \"check and create\" every time you access an app path.</li>\n<li>We resolved a long-standing instability in the macOS and iOS testbed app that <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3557\">caused intermittent failures in the <code>WebView</code> tests</a></li>\n<li>We added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3552\">topic guide on managing file system access in Toga apps</a>.</li>\n<li>We modified the handling of font specifications in Toga apps. You can now provide <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3526\">a list of fonts</a>, as you would in CSS, and the first available font in that list will be used.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3570\">corrected a number of issues with document-based apps</a>.

This is ultimately a very small change adding a list of allowed tags to the underlying PyPI codebase - but it is an important step towards the goal of having the Python ecosystem support iOS and Android as a first class citizen.</li>\n<li>We submitted a pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2286\">adding iOS support to <code>cibuildwheel</code></a>. With this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS with a single command: <code>CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</code>. As proof, we <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pyspamsum/1.0.7/#files\">built and published iOS wheels for a simple binary package</a>. For completeness, we also built and uploaded Android wheels using our <a href=\"https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/blob/master/server/pypi/README.md\">existing Chaquopy-based build tooling</a>; in the near future, we're hoping to replace that with a <code>cibuildwheel</code>-based approach as well.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/578\">completed a major refactor of the BeeWare website</a>. This dramatically simplifies the structure of some parts of the website - most notably, the projects page. A huge thanks to community member <a href=\"https://kattni.com\">Kattni</a> for all their hard work on this refactor.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.22/\">released Briefcase 0.3.22</a>. This is a bug fix release to silence a warning raised during builds caused by the release of pip 25.0. This warning had the potential to become an error at an unknown point in the future, so we decided to push out a low-feature release to avoid that possibility.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.9/\">released Toga 0.4.9</a>. This release contains only 1 change over the 0.4.8 release - it imposes an upper bound on the version of Travertino that it specifies as a requirement. This ensures that when we release the next version of Travertino, we don't need to accommodate compatibility with Toga 0.4 APIs.</li>\n<li>We added <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3087\">initial support for GTK4 to Toga</a>. This is only the very initial phases of GTK4 support - most widgets aren't currently supported - but the basic infrastructure that allows a GTK4 app to start <em>at all</em> now exists. We now need to go through the process of porting every GTK widget for GTK4 compatibility. Thanks to the work we did on the Toga 0.4 widget audit, we have a comprehensive test suite that we can use to evaluate progress on this task.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2484\">corrected some issues with background color handling on Windows</a>, including adding support for transparency on widget backgrounds. This also included adding support for <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3140\">alpha blending to Travertino</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3181\">corrected a long-standing issue that caused instability in Toga's iOS tests</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129200\">corrected a problem with the CPython iOS test runner</a> that prevented multiple test runners starting at the same time, and <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130292\">another problem that was caused when running the runner under CI conditions</a>.</li>\n<li>We upgraded the CPython iOS buildbot to run on macOS Sonoma, and Xcode 16.4; this some issues with iOS 18 compatibility that we have resolved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's next?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-next\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In March we will continue to work on binary packaging. Although it is now possible to upload binary wheels to PyPI, that capability isn't much use unless projects are able to build those wheels in the first place. In the process of developing the pull request for <code>cibuildwheel</code>, we've identified a gap in the <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/\">PEP 517</a> specification associated with building more complex binary packages, and a set of missing features in virtual environments in a cross-platform build configuration. We have some ideas for how to fill these gaps; but we need to do some more experimentation to prove that those approaches will work as expected. The eventual goal will be to author a PEP to address these gaps in the PEP 517 standard. We should also be able to begin the process of adding Android binary wheel support, mirroring the changes we've made for iOS over the past months.</p>\n<p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten buildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to resolve, and then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython buildbot fleet.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it looks like the work we were planning on Toga's Web backend will be deferred. We believed we may have had an opportunity to work with another group at Anaconda to improve Toga's web backend, but that opportunity looks like it will not eventuate. We're still interested in improving the web backend, but we probably won't be able to commit significant resources to that project in the near future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-get-involved\">Want to get involved?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#want-to-get-involved\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Want to get involved?

This is mostly useful for specifying alternative package repositories (with <code>--index-url</code> or <code>--extra-index-url</code>) or local folders that contain wheels (with <code>--find-links</code>); but any pip arguments can be passed down to the pip invocation.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2075\">corrected an error in the default D-Bus configuration of Flatpak apps</a>.</li>\n<li>We resolved a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/543\">long-standing memory management issue in Rubicon</a>. This change removes almost all need for manual memory management of ObjC objects, making iOS and macOS development much more robust. It also resolves some memory leak issues on Toga's iOS backend.</li>\n<li>We added support for CPython to <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/127592\">stream <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> to the system log on iOS and macOS</a>.

This will significantly reduce the likelihood of bugs landing in main that will break the Android buildbots.</li>\n<li>We spent a significant amount of time <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/12777\">dealing with an update to GitHub Actions</a>. On August 11, GitHub rolled out an update to the disk image they use for macOS 15 machines - and in the process, broke the tools that BeeWare uses to test iOS applications. It took almost a week to identify the cause of this problem, and develop a fix. However, the good news is that <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138018\">the fix significantly simplifies the iOS testing process</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138176\">began the process of adding official Python binaries for iOS</a>. The complexity of iOS multi-architecture builds makes official builds a little more complicated than Android, but we're hopeful this work will be able to land in the near future.</li>\n<li>We added a recipe for building <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps/pull/64\">iOS binaries for <code>zstandard</code></a>. These are needed to support the new <code>zstandard</code> compression library in Python 3.14.</li>\n<li>We released a <a href=\"https://beeware.org/mobile-wheels/\">website to track the status of binary wheel support for iOS and Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We released <a href=\"http://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.25/\">Briefcase 0.3.25</a>.

This change allows us to simplify the contents of the support packages.</li>\n<li>We made Briefcase <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2429\">more resilient to badly packaged binary wheels on macOS</a>.

Going forward, you can expect that BeeWare's quarterly plans will be published a couple of weeks into the quarter.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"q3-progress\">Q3 progress<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q3-progress\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The end of Q3 sees the release of a new Python version - 3.14. The 3.14 release contains official Android binary artefacts, and a number of improvements to the iOS build process that will lead to official iOS binary artefacts, hopefully in the near future. It also contains restored support for Emscripten as a Tier 3 supported platform. Landing these improvements in 3.14, and ensuring that the BeeWare ecosystem is in a position to use those changes, was a subject of considerable effort in Q3. We were also forced to respond to a number of significant changes to the GitHub Actions macOS ecosystem - work that is ongoing as a side effect of macOS 26 changes and the deprecation of Intel as a supported macOS platform.</p>\n<p>We continued to make progress on the state of binary packaging for iOS and Android. <code>cibuildwheel</code> 3.1 included support for Android that we contributed; as a result, it is now possible for projects to have CI pipelines that generate both iOS and Android wheels. We now have a <a href=\"https://beeware.org/mobile-wheels/\">leaderboard of mobile wheel support in Python</a>, and we're starting to see others in the Python community contribute iOS and Android support updates to popular Python projects. We've also been able to consolidate some of the work that we've done on establishing cross-platform environments into a single standalone package - <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/xbuild/\"><code>xbuild</code></a> - that can be used to replicate the functionality that <code>cibuildwheel</code> relies on for cross-platform builds.</p>\n<p>We made many improvements in Briefcase's Windows installer support. This began with migrating to a current version of WiX, which then allowed us to add several new features, including displaying a license agreement, offering installation options, and running custom installer and uninstaller scripts.</p>\n<p>BeeWare's documentation has also seen some significant improvements. Building on the improvements to the website, we've been able to begin switching our documentation from using reStructuredText to Markdown. reStructuredText is a markup standard that is historically significant in the Python community, but sees very little use elsewhere. It's clear that the rest of the online world has adopted Markdown, and Markdown is also significantly simpler as a syntax; we're hoping that these two factors should make it easier for new contributors to get involved in BeeWare development, and simplify some documentation tasks for BeeWare maintainers. We've already ported many of our READMEs, our tutorial, and Toga's documentation to Markdown format, with more changes to come.</p>\n<p>Our students from Curtin University have almost concluded their capstone projects. As a result, Briefcase now has significantly improved deployment options for web-based projects, and the foundations for some significant improvements to how Briefcase uses virtual environments are in place. Although our students will be signing off shortly, we expect to be able to deliver some substantial improvements to Briefcase using these features in the coming quarter.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we had a successful attendance at EuroPython, PyCon AU, and PyCon UK, presenting multiple talks, tutorials, and introducing a large number of people to Open Source contribution through the sprints. We also attended the Python Core Team sprint, providing a great opportunity to finalize some details in the 3.14 release, and discuss our plans for the upcoming 3.15 release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"q4-priorities\">Q4 priorities<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q4-priorities\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Q4, we're hoping to make one final push on binary packaging for mobile platforms. In addition to wrapping up work on some of the more notable scientific Python packages (such as NumPy and Pandas), we intend to look into packages that are built using Rust. Rust is becoming an increasingly important part of the Python binary ecosystem, and Rust already has support for iOS and Android. However, we need to make sure that Python/Rust tools like Maturin are able to support cross compilation.</p>\n<p>We also want to wrap up our work getting iOS binary artefacts as part of the CPython release process, and work on getting those artefacts into use with Briefcase. This will require some improvements to Briefcase, making use of the <code>xbuild</code> package, and the work contributed by our Curtin University students.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longer-term-goals\">Longer term goals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#longer-term-goals\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Looking to 2026, after 2 years of building a foundation for a stable, officially supported story for Python on mobile, we can turn our attention back to the apps that people build with BeeWare. This will mean filling some functionality gaps in Toga to satisfy some common app requirements, and writing more documentation and tutorials to help people write apps with BeeWare's tools.</p>\n<p>We're also expecting that 2026 will see more integration between BeeWare's tools and other packaging tools. We're already exploring ways that Briefcase can integrate better with Conda. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase development story, and some of the changes landed by our Curtin students make exploring these options much easier.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-28T03:56:06.997206+00:00", "date_published": "2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "russell@beeware.org (Russell Keith-Magee)"}], "tags": ["Buzz"]}, {"id": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/2025q3-roadmap/", "url": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/2025q3-roadmap/", "title": "2025Q3 Roadmap", "content_html": "<p>In Q2, BeeWare reached some public milestones in our iOS binary packaging, and saw some unexpected improvements in our documentation and website.

We're still waiting on a formal release of meson and meson-python that includes the iOS changes that we provided; once those releases occur, we'll be able to submit patches for even more projects. We also continued to work on supporting Android in <code>cibuildwheel</code>. This work is still in the review phase; we're hoping it will be concluded in the near future.</p>\n<p>A CPython buildbot for Emscripten is now live. The process of launching this buildbot revealed a number of bugs that required resolution; a small number of bugs still remain. We don't anticipate any issue resolving these before the 3.14.0 final release. The draft PEPs defining the Emscripten platform (PEP 776) and Emscripten wheel tagging (PEP 783) have not seen any major progress.</p>\n<p>Our students from Curtin University have concluded their first semester of work, providing implementations for a range of Toga widgets on the web platform, finding (and resolving) a number of bugs along the way. They've also made a number of small improvements to Briefcase. As part of their work, they've laid out plans for more substantial contributions in the second half of the year. These contributions should result in significant improvements to the development experience for Toga's web backend.</p>\n<p>We also saw a lot of unexpected improvements in BeeWare's documentation and website. We now have a much improved translation infrastructure for BeeWare's website. A significant review of the structure of the documentation of the major BeeWare projects is also underway, addressing both visual consistency, and the integration of the documentation projects into the overall web presence of the BeeWare project.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we had a successful PyCon US attendance, presenting multiple talks, a tutorials, and introducing a large number of people to Open Source contribution through the sprints.</p>\n<h2 id=\"q3-priorities\">Q3 priorities<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q3-priorities\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Q3, we will have two major areas of focus for BeeWare development.</p>\n<p>The first, unsurprisingly, is to continue working on binary packaging. We'll continue working on the <code>cibuildwheel</code> patch to support building Android wheels; and we'll continue the process of submitting patches for iOS support to notable packages. Some of this work is dependent on formal releases of meson and meson-python; we'll progress as fast as the published state of the ecosystem allows.</p>\n<p>The second area of focus is generating iOS and Android binary artefacts as part of the CPython release process. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which should limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>We'll also be attending EuroPython in July; PyCon AU, CPython core team summit and PyCon UK in September. These are important events for community outreach and for collaboration with other projects and the core team - but they'll obviously place constraints on the progress we make in the quarter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longer-term-goals\">Longer term goals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#longer-term-goals\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The long term goals of BeeWare remain largely the same. Once we've developed a compelling story for mobile binary packaging, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga. There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare support channels. Unless pull requests are submitted from the broader community, it is unlikely that we'll make any substantial progress on this front until the end of this year, or perhaps early next year.</p>\n<p>We're also intending to look at tooling other than <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> for building Briefcase packages. Integration with Conda is one obvious goal, as it provides rich tooling for distributing complex binary requirements. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase development story. Again, it is unlikely that we'll make any progress on this front before the end of this year.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-28T03:56:06.990970+00:00", "date_published": "2025-07-02T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "russell@beeware.org (Russell Keith-Magee)"}], "tags": ["Buzz"]}]}
