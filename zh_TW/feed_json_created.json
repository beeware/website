More details about our first semester\ncontributions can be found <a href=\"../2025-curtin-university-capstone-project---semester-end/\">in our first semester\nreport</a>. After this, the team split\noff into pairs to plan out larger deliverable contributions that would add or\nchanges features within BeeWare.</p>\n<p>It is these deliverables that the team worked on in the second semester.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-weve-worked-on-this-semester\">What We\u2019ve Worked On This Semester<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-weve-worked-on-this-semester\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"toga-web-testing\">Toga Web Testing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#toga-web-testing\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>This semester, we delivered a functional prototype of a testing mechanism for\nToga\u2019s Web backend. This prototype addresses the problems identified in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/3545\">analysis we performed during our first\nsemester</a>. The problem was\nstraightforward: there wasn\u2019t a practical, end-to-end way to run automated tests\nagainst Toga web apps running in the browser. Our prototype addresses this by\nintroducing a structured communication bridge between the backend, and the\nfrontend, widget proxies, and DOM probes. This enables end-to-end tests that\ntests both widget logic and rendered UI. At this stage, the work serves as a\nproof-of-concept approach rather than a finished product. It demonstrates that\nthe core approach works reliably, though additional features and improvements\nremain to be implemented. Our proof-of-concept prototype can be found within our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3728\">draft pull request</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"briefcase-web-development-optimizations\">Briefcase Web Development Optimizations<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#briefcase-web-development-optimizations\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>We also laid the groundwork for web platform development mode support in\nBriefcase by making the <code>dev</code> command platform-aware, and implementing virtual\nenvironment management. We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2419\">refactored the core <code>DevCommand</code>\narchitecture</a> by introducing\nplatform-specific <code>DevCommand</code> subclasses like <code>StaticWebDevCommand</code> to handle\nplatform-dependent workflows). Next, we <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2420\">implemented virtual environment\nmanagement</a> by introducing the\n<code>VirtualEnvironment</code> context manager tool, which provides isolated, configurable\nvirtual environments for development mode, and <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2495\">improved the tracking of virtual\nenvironment usage by the dev\ncommand</a>. We also <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2498\">modified the\nhandling of local Python assets</a>\nso they are installed in editable mode. This work establishes the foundation for\nexposing the app assets to a development web server allowing the live-reload\nworkflow, ultimately speeding up the web development process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pyscript-briefcase-and-toga-dependencies\">PyScript Briefcase and Toga Dependencies<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#pyscript-briefcase-and-toga-dependencies\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Lastly, we worked on redesigning the Briefcase static web build pipeline to\nimplement a deterministic asset insertion system which replaced template-based\nasset management. The new system enables Toga and other toolkits to embed their\nconfiguration files and front-end resources directly <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3666\">into wheel\npackages</a> which <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2442\">new Briefcase\nfunctionality</a> will extract and\ninsert into static web files. The <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-web-static-template/pull/21\">web template received a\nredesign</a>\nwhich established specific areas for insertion. The <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2337\">previous\nrestrictions</a> prevented Toga\nand other toolkits from taking full control of their front-end operations while\nworking independently from Briefcase. The new system separates tasks while\nmaking maintenance easier and enables toolkits to manage their front-end\ncomponents, with Toga now owning its own PyScript version, PyScript\nconfiguration and Shoelace HTML script.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#lessons-learned\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This year with BeeWare has marked many valuable lessons taught outside of the\nclass environment. Each of us have now made significant contributions to an Open\nSource project while meeting deadlines and attending weekly stand-up meetings.\nThis process has allowed us to develop our skills in numerous ways. Below each\nof us will comment our individual lessons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kavidu\"><nospell>Kavidu</nospell><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#kavidu\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Working with BeeWare was my first professional experience outside of university.\nThis was a huge opportunity for me to have hands-on exposure to real-world\nsoftware development work within Open Source environments. I gained experience\nworking with large community-based codebases through issue tracking and pull\nrequest management while teaming up with developers who used different time\nzones and technical expertise.</p>\n<p>The experience helped me develop better abilities to work with others while\nimproving my skills in team collaboration. The combination of weekly stand-ups\nand code reviews and asynchronous teamwork helped me develop skills to explain\ntechnical concepts simply and receive feedback positively while creating code\nthat others could understand and expand. I developed better skills in Python\nprogramming, testing and I learned to create testable code that other developers\ncould use to extend the project.</p>\n<p>Moreover, working with BeeWare provided me with essential knowledge about Open\nSource software engineering through its combination of technical and\ncollaborative aspects. Throughout the process, I learned that the development of\ngood software requires designers to create intentional systems while they must\ncommunicate effectively to build tools which enable others to continue improving\nthe project after their contribution ends.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mitchell\">Mitchell<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#mitchell\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>One of the most valuable lessons from BeeWare came while implementing a virtual\nenvironment context manager for Briefcase.</p>\n<p>During the planning and initial development, I was too focused on how this would\nwork for the web development platform rather than on the actual design of the\ntool itself. My supervisor pointed out that this PR had applications in other\nareas within Briefcase and should be designed with those considerations in mind.</p>\n<p>I had been thinking in terms of \"what does the web platform need?\" when I should\nhave been asking \"what capability does the system need?\" This misunderstanding\naffected my initial timeline and resulted in a much longer development cycle\nthan intended, but it taught me something far more valuable. The real insight\nwas that development shouldn't be task-specific but tool-specific.</p>\n<p>When working on something, it's not about what works for today's problem but\nwhat tool you're building that will work for any problem that emerges tomorrow.\nGood design means separating mechanism from policy: your tool provides the\n<em>how</em>, and each caller decides the <em>where</em>, <em>when</em>, and <em>why</em>. The goal isn't to\npredict every use case but to build tools that others can use as-is, without\nmodification.</p>\n<p>When someone needs virtual environment management six months from now in a\ncompletely different context, they shouldn't have to change your code\u2014they\nshould just be able to call it with their parameters and move on. Build it once\nso it works everywhere, not once per use case.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the best code is not the code that works today but rather the code\nthat's still working unchanged a year from now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"veronica\">Veronica<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#veronica\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>As this was my first experience contributing to a large, Open Source project, I\nlearned how the workflow fits together\u2014navigating existing code, writing clear\nissues and PRs, and contributing changes with clear commits and messages. I also\nlearned to keep my work visible, pushing incremental changes, even when not\nfully finished, with clear notes on status and next steps so reviewers can\nfollow my progress. That was a shift for me, as I used to wait for \u201cfinished\u201d\nwork before committing.</p>\n<p>Regular stand-ups, shared planning, and pairing on tasks taught me how to work\neffectively in a team. Through this, I developed stronger communication and\ncollaboration skills and gained a better understanding of how individual\ncontributions fit within a larger shared goal, especially when it comes to\ncoding workflows.</p>\n<p>I've improved my Python skills and gained real experience with <code>pytest</code> and\nPlaywright while working on the Toga Web Testing prototype. Most importantly, I\nlearned how to design a cross-process system that bridges a <code>pytest</code> test runner\nto an app running in the browser, which gave me a much deeper understanding of\nboth testing frameworks and web automation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jaeden\"><nospell>Jaeden</nospell><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#jaeden\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Beginning with limited Python knowledge increased the learning curve for me\nhowever by reflecting at the end of this journey I can see the difference in\nskills I have gained. I am more confident and familiar now working on a project\nalongside other software engineers discussing ideas whilst maintaining\nprofessional communication practices via weekly stand-up calls and email.\nWorking on Briefcase has taught me to simplify my code more. After regular code\nreviews from Russell, I realized my code was always more complicated than\nnecessary and could often be simplified either by using in built Python\nfunctions or functions already defined somewhere in the codebase that I wasn't\naware of.</p>\n<h3 id=\"callum\"><nospell>Callum</nospell><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#callum\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Throughout this project, I learned that effective communication is one of the\nmost important aspects of collaborative software development. Working on the\nsame codebase as others required constant coordination to prevent overlap and\nensure our work aligned technically and conceptually. Regular discussions and\nupdates helped us avoid duplicated effort and made it easier to maintain a\nshared understanding of the project\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>I learned that transparency, even when work is still in progress, is far more\nvaluable than delaying updates. This also ties closely to the importance of\nmaintaining visibility in an Open Source context, where an up-to-date and\ntraceable history of commits allows others to easily follow development and\nprovide frequent, relevant feedback. Consistently sharing progress, even in\nsmall increments, made collaboration far more effective.</p>\n<p>Finally, I learned the importance of handover reports and how essential they are\nfor communicating the current state and future direction of a project. A\nwell-written handover report provides clarity on what has been implemented, what\nhas not worked as intended, and what areas require further development or\nrefactoring. It also serves as a bridge for future contributors, ensuring that\nknowledge is not lost and that others can continue the work without repeating\npast mistakes. Through this process, I came to appreciate that clear\ndocumentation at the end of a project is just as valuable as the technical work\nitself, as it enables continuity and long-term maintainability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"caydn\"><nospell>Caydn</nospell><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#caydn\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>This year has taught me how to work effectively within both a small team and a\nlarge Open Source project. It's been very eye opening navigating the\nexpectations and workflows that come with contributing to a community-driven\ncodebase. During the first semester, I found that I didn't know how much to push\nor when to create a PR. This meant that Russell couldn't perceive work being\ncompleted and that I could not receive help in situations where I was stuck.\nWith our semester 2 work, especially as we were working in pairs, I made it a\ngoal to commit and push any slight change. This drastically improved our\ncollaboration efforts.</p>\n<p>I've also gained confidence and appreciation for modular architecture through\nworking on the PyScript insertion system. Previously, having only worked on\nsmaller codebases of my own or for group assignment work, I've never truly\nworked on multiple systems that would interact with each other. Having spent\ntime reconfiguring dependencies within BeeWare, I've now learned the value of\nplanning and researching before implementation. The untangling of Toga and the\nStatic Web Template has been some of the most fun I've had within programming\nthus far. I'm looking forward to seeing how BeeWare continues to make use of and\nexpand on this system.</p>\n<p>Collaborative feedback and reviews from Russell, Malcolm, and the team,\nespecially <nospell>Kavidu</nospell> have undoubtedly improved our code quality\nand allowed me to grow as a software engineer. While initially scary to have\nfrequent check ins with my code, I've now placed much more importance in these\nreviews. Not only does it allow you to gain insight into what may be going\nwrong, but more experienced developers tend to impart their wisdom upon you. For\nme, this now means I pay much closer attention to deep indentation as well as\nthe readability and traceability of my written code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-work\">Future work<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#future-work\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>While we have delivered significant changes within the BeeWare ecosystem,\ncontinued efforts will be required to complete our works. Each deliverable\nvaries in terms of remaining tasks.</p>\n<p>The Toga Web Testing prototype provides a strong foundation for a complete\ntesting framework but remains at a proof-of-concept stage. Future work will\nfocus on extending test coverage across more widgets, stabilizing the proxy and\n<nospell>RPC</nospell> systems and integration with Briefcase to enable a\nunified startup process for web tests. More details on the current\nimplementation and next steps can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/3545#issuecomment-3425284525\">Toga Web Testing Handover\nReport</a>.</p>\n<p>The <code>briefcase dev</code> command now has the basic foundations to support a true\ndevelopment workflow for web applications, enabling live-editing and hot-reload\nwithout requiring wheel builds. The remaining work focuses on implementing a\nparser to locate editable source code paths from <code>.pth</code> files, creating symlinks\nor file copies in the web project\u2019s static directory so PyScript can load\nmodules directly from local source files, generating the necessary HTML and\nPyScript configuration to run these modules in the browser, and integrating the\ndevelopment server to bring all these components together. Once completed, these\nenhancements will enable developers to modify Python source files and instantly\nsee their changes reflected in the browser.

As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide\nto what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard\ncommitment to features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>\n<p>This Q4 roadmap has been published a little later than normal so that we can fit\nin with quarterly planning cadence at Anaconda (who employ two of the BeeWare\ncore team). Going forward, you can expect that BeeWare's quarterly plans will be\npublished a couple of weeks into the quarter.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"q3-progress\">Q3 progress<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q3-progress\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The end of Q3 sees the release of a new Python version - 3.14. The 3.14 release\ncontains official Android binary artefacts, and a number of improvements to the\niOS build process that will lead to official iOS binary artefacts, hopefully in\nthe near future. It also contains restored support for Emscripten as a Tier 3\nsupported platform. Landing these improvements in 3.14, and ensuring that the\nBeeWare ecosystem is in a position to use those changes, was a subject of\nconsiderable effort in Q3. We were also forced to respond to a number of\nsignificant changes to the GitHub Actions macOS ecosystem - work that is ongoing\nas a side effect of macOS 26 changes and the deprecation of Intel as a supported\nmacOS platform.</p>\n<p>We continued to make progress on the state of binary packaging for iOS and\nAndroid. <code>cibuildwheel</code> 3.1 included support for Android that we contributed; as\na result, it is now possible for projects to have CI pipelines that generate\nboth iOS and Android wheels. We now have a <a href=\"https://beeware.org/mobile-wheels/\">leaderboard of mobile wheel support\nin Python</a>, and we're starting to see others\nin the Python community contribute iOS and Android support updates to popular\nPython projects. We've also been able to consolidate some of the work that we've\ndone on establishing cross-platform environments into a single standalone\npackage - <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/xbuild/\"><code>xbuild</code></a> - that can be used to\nreplicate the functionality that <code>cibuildwheel</code> relies on for cross-platform\nbuilds.</p>\n<p>We made many improvements in Briefcase's Windows installer support. This began\nwith migrating to a current version of WiX, which then allowed us to add several\nnew features, including displaying a license agreement, offering installation\noptions, and running custom installer and uninstaller scripts.</p>\n<p>BeeWare's documentation has also seen some significant improvements. Building on\nthe improvements to the website, we've been able to begin switching our\ndocumentation from using reStructuredText to Markdown. reStructuredText is a\nmarkup standard that is historically significant in the Python community, but\nsees very little use elsewhere. It's clear that the rest of the online world has\nadopted Markdown, and Markdown is also significantly simpler as a syntax; we're\nhoping that these two factors should make it easier for new contributors to get\ninvolved in BeeWare development, and simplify some documentation tasks for\nBeeWare maintainers. We've already ported many of our READMEs, our tutorial, and\nToga's documentation to Markdown format, with more changes to come.</p>\n<p>Our students from Curtin University have almost concluded their capstone\nprojects. As a result, Briefcase now has significantly improved deployment\noptions for web-based projects, and the foundations for some significant\nimprovements to how Briefcase uses virtual environments are in place. Although\nour students will be signing off shortly, we expect to be able to deliver some\nsubstantial improvements to Briefcase using these features in the coming\nquarter.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we had a successful attendance at EuroPython, PyCon AU, and PyCon UK,\npresenting multiple talks, tutorials, and introducing a large number of people\nto Open Source contribution through the sprints. We also attended the Python\nCore Team sprint, providing a great opportunity to finalize some details in the\n3.14 release, and discuss our plans for the upcoming 3.15 release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"q4-priorities\">Q4 priorities<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q4-priorities\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Q4, we're hoping to make one final push on binary packaging for mobile\nplatforms. In addition to wrapping up work on some of the more notable\nscientific Python packages (such as NumPy and Pandas), we intend to look into\npackages that are built using Rust. Rust is becoming an increasingly important\npart of the Python binary ecosystem, and Rust already has support for iOS and\nAndroid. However, we need to make sure that Python/Rust tools like Maturin are\nable to support cross compilation.</p>\n<p>We also want to wrap up our work getting iOS binary artefacts as part of the\nCPython release process, and work on getting those artefacts into use with\nBriefcase. This will require some improvements to Briefcase, making use of the\n<code>xbuild</code> package, and the work contributed by our Curtin University students.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longer-term-goals\">Longer term goals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#longer-term-goals\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Looking to 2026, after 2 years of building a foundation for a stable, officially\nsupported story for Python on mobile, we can turn our attention back to the apps\nthat people build with BeeWare. This will mean filling some functionality gaps\nin Toga to satisfy some common app requirements, and writing more documentation\nand tutorials to help people write apps with BeeWare's tools.</p>\n<p>We're also expecting that 2026 will see more integration between BeeWare's tools\nand other packaging tools. We're already exploring ways that Briefcase can\nintegrate better with Conda. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the\nBriefcase development story, and some of the changes landed by our Curtin\nstudents make exploring these options much easier.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-28T03:57:42.242345+00:00", "date_published": "2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "russell@beeware.org (Russell Keith-Magee)"}], "tags": ["Buzz"]}, {"id": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/september-2025-status-update/", "url": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/september-2025-status-update/", "title": "September 2025 Status Update", "content_html": "<p>September has been a busy month for conference travel, but we've also managed to\nmake some important improvements to projects in the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"what-weve-done\">What we've done<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-weve-done\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We attended <a href=\"https://2025.pycon.org.au\">PyCon AU</a>, giving a presentation about\n  the process of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytlbiDF0Ba4\">creating Android and iOS\n  wheels</a>.</li>\n<li>We attended the CPython core team summit at the ARM campus in Cambridge, UK.\n  This was an opportunity to finalize work on the upcoming 3.14 release, and\n  discuss plans for the 3.15 release cycle.

The complexity of iOS\n  multi-architecture builds makes official builds a little more complicated than\n  Android, but we're hopeful this work will be able to land in the near future.</li>\n<li>We added a recipe for building <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps/pull/64\">iOS binaries for\n  <code>zstandard</code></a>.\n  These are needed to support the new <code>zstandard</code> compression library in Python\n  3.14.</li>\n<li>We released a <a href=\"https://beeware.org/mobile-wheels/\">website to track the status of binary wheel support for iOS and\n  Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We released <a href=\"http://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.25/\">Briefcase 0.3.25</a>.\n  This release was primarily required because of a change to Android Play Store\n  target SDK requirements.</li>\n<li>We modified how Briefcase <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2443\">determines the minimum supported macOS/iOS version\n  that Python requires</a>.

We're still waiting\non a formal release of meson and meson-python that includes the iOS changes that\nwe provided; once those releases occur, we'll be able to submit patches for even\nmore projects.

As part of their work, they've laid\nout plans for more substantial contributions in the second half of the year.\nThese contributions should result in significant improvements to the development\nexperience for Toga's web backend.</p>\n<p>We also saw a lot of unexpected improvements in BeeWare's documentation and\nwebsite. We now have a much improved translation infrastructure for BeeWare's\nwebsite. A significant review of the structure of the documentation of the major\nBeeWare projects is also underway, addressing both visual consistency, and the\nintegration of the documentation projects into the overall web presence of the\nBeeWare project.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we had a successful PyCon US attendance, presenting multiple talks, a\ntutorials, and introducing a large number of people to Open Source contribution\nthrough the sprints.</p>\n<h2 id=\"q3-priorities\">Q3 priorities<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q3-priorities\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Q3, we will have two major areas of focus for BeeWare development.</p>\n<p>The first, unsurprisingly, is to continue working on binary packaging. We'll\ncontinue working on the <code>cibuildwheel</code> patch to support building Android wheels;\nand we'll continue the process of submitting patches for iOS support to notable\npackages. Some of this work is dependent on formal releases of meson and\nmeson-python; we'll progress as fast as the published state of the ecosystem\nallows.</p>\n<p>The second area of focus is generating iOS and Android binary artefacts as part\nof the CPython release process. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS\nand Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which should limit the\nincidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>We'll also be attending EuroPython in July; PyCon AU, CPython core team summit\nand PyCon UK in September. These are important events for community outreach and\nfor collaboration with other projects and the core team - but they'll obviously\nplace constraints on the progress we make in the quarter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longer-term-goals\">Longer term goals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#longer-term-goals\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The long term goals of BeeWare remain largely the same. Once we've developed a\ncompelling story for mobile binary packaging, we'll be able to turn our focus\nback to Toga. There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that\nneed to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common\ndevelopment patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare support\nchannels. Unless pull requests are submitted from the broader community, it is\nunlikely that we'll make any substantial progress on this front until the end of\nthis year, or perhaps early next year.</p>\n<p>We're also intending to look at tooling other than <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> for building\nBriefcase packages. Integration with Conda is one obvious goal, as it provides\nrich tooling for distributing complex binary requirements. <code>uv</code> is another tool\nthat might fit well in the Briefcase development story.

The web platform is\nincompatible with this as WebAssembly does not support multithreading. To\naddress this, we are working on developing a general approach that allows the\ntest suite and testbed app to run in separate processes. This will include using\nproxy objects in place of Toga objects in the test suite that will wrap the\nrespective object in the testbed app, forwarding commands to it in order to\nchange its state and retrieve data.</p>\n<p>Additionally, to verify the rendered state of the testbed app, we plan to use\nPlaywright to inspect the browser's DOM and compare it against what the test\nsuite expects. This setup should allow the web platform to be effectively tested\nwhile still using the existing test suite.</p>\n<p>More technical details and discussion can be found in our <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/discussions/3440\">Discussion\nPost</a> on Toga and the\nassociated <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/3545\">Issue Ticket</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pyscript-briefcase-and-toga-dependencies\">PyScript Briefcase and Toga Dependencies<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#pyscript-briefcase-and-toga-dependencies\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>During Mitchell\u2019s development of the <code>DateInput</code> Web Widget, we discovered some\nissues resulting from how PyScript APIs were being used. This issue was resolved\nseparately but sparked broader discussions about the ownership of PyScript,\nShoelace, and Bootstrap within the wider BeeWare architecture. Currently, the\nBriefcase web template includes these directly in <code>index.html</code>, but they should\nideally be managed as dependencies of Toga.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re proposing to shift ownership of these dependencies to Toga and other\ntoolkits, enabling them to define their own configurations and inserts while\nkeeping Briefcase focused purely on packaging. This would allow for clearer\nversion control, better modularity, and easier maintenance across the ecosystem.\nThis approach builds on prior work\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1285\">briefcase#1285</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1945\">toga#1945</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-web-static-template/pull/9\">briefcase-web-static-template#9</a>)\nand introduces a mechanism for toolkit-managed inserts and configuration. We\nplan on reviving parts of these to allow for Toga to specify PyScript\nversioning.</p>\n<p>More technical details and discussion can be found in our <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/discussions/2283\">Discussion\nPost</a> on Briefcase and\nthe associated <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2337\">Issue Ticket</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"briefcase-web-development-optimizations\">Briefcase Web Development Optimizations<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#briefcase-web-development-optimizations\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>While contributing to Toga's web widgets, we noticed that testing even small\nchanges requires rebuilding all project wheels (with <code>briefcase run web -r -u</code>),\nwhich can take a significant amount of time. This makes local development slow\nand interrupts the feedback loop needed for efficient frontend iteration.</p>\n<p>To improve this we're going to be working on extending the <code>dev</code> command to be\nplatform aware and make it so <code>dev web</code> utilizes editable installs to serve your\nproject to the browser making it so with simple refresh of the browser you can\nquickly see your changes instead of waiting for a full wheel rebuild.</p>\n<p>More technical details and discussion can be found in our <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/discussions/2282\">Discussion\nPost</a> on Briefcase and\nthe associated <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2334\">Issue Ticket</a>.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-28T03:57:42.201799+00:00", "date_published": "2025-06-13T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Kavidu Abeykoon Mudiyanselagedara"}, {"name": "Callum Horton"}, {"name": "Caydn Lee"}, {"name": "Jaeden Mah"}, {"name": "Mitchell Pontague"}, {"name": "Veronica Taniputra"}], "tags": ["Buzz"]}, {"id": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/may-2025-status-update/", "url": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/may-2025-status-update/", "title": "May 2025 Status Update", "content_html": "<p>During May, BeeWare saw a number of major improvements - many of which came as a\nresult of our attendance at PyCon US 2025.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"what-weve-done\">What we've done<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-weve-done\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We attended PyCon US!

We're now at a point where the code\nrequired to support iOS is mostly in place; and the code to support Android is\n<em>almost</em> in place; however, it will be difficult to make further progress until\nthose changes are available in public releases.</p>\n<p>So, in June, we'll be changing focus. We're aiming to take a look at Briefcase,\nwith 2 major improvements in mind. Firstly, we want to upgrade our Windows\npackaging story, and upgrade our WiX support from WiX 3 to a current version.\nThis should resolve some issues with packaging large apps and apps with lots of\nfiles; it should also enable us to package applications for ARM64. Secondly,\nwe've had some requests to expose Briefcase's packaging and signing\ninfrastructure so it can be used on projects that <em>aren't</em> built with Briefcase\n- we're hoping to add this as well.</p>\n<p>We're also hoping to follow up on some of our discussion with the Python core\nteam at PyCon, and begin the process of integrating the production of iOS and\nAndroid binary artefacts into Python releases. This will hopefully also involve\nintegrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which will\nhopefully limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break\niOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support. Last month, we\nthought we were one issue away from a working buildbot; however, some new issues\nhave emerged since then. We still hope to have a working buildbot before 3.14 is\nfinalized, which will restore Emscripten to Tier 3 status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-get-involved\">Want to get involved?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#want-to-get-involved\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Want to get involved?

Android support in <code>cibuildwheel</code> is also progressing; once those\nchanges are in place, and a <code>cibuildwheel</code> version with iOS and Android support\nhas been officially released, we will be able to start officially submitting\npatches to upstream projects to support iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Progress on Python Emscripten support stalled this month due to other\ncommitments.

PyPI now accepts binary wheel uploads; and we have uploaded wheels for\none package (<code>pyspamsum</code>) to prove that this support works. We've also\ncontributed changes in <code>cibuildwheel</code> that supports the creation of iOS binary\nwheels. We need to wait until those changes are in an official <code>cibuildwheel</code>\nrelease before we can contribute patches upstream for other projects, but we\nhave patches for a couple of projects ready to submit as soon as there is an\nofficial release to use. We've completed some preparatory work in CPython and\npip to support building Android binary wheels, but the changes to <code>cibuildwheel</code>\nto support Android wheels are still in the early stages of development.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our collaboration with the PyScript team didn't work out as\nexpected; the opportunity to work with the PyScript team that we anticipated did\nnot eventuate. However, a group of students from Curtin University will be\nworking on Toga's web backend as part of their final year capstone project. This\nwill include making modifications to Briefcase to support testing web-based\napps. This project will run until the end of the year; we look forward to seeing\nthe progress they're able to make.</p>\n<p>However, we <em>have</em> made good progress on Emscripten support in CPython. A\nbuildbot for Emscripten is almost ready to launch; having a stable buildbot is a\nmajor milestone in restoring Emscripten to Tier 3 support in CPython. Draft PEPs\ndefining the Emscripten platform (PEP 776) and Emscripten wheel tagging (PEP\n783) are currently in discussion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"q2-priorities\">Q2 priorities<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q2-priorities\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Q2, we're planning to continue working on binary packaging for mobile\nplatforms. This work will take three forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We'll continue working on the <code>cibuildwheel</code> patch to support building Android\n  wheels. Now that the iOS patch has landed in <code>cibuildwheel</code>, we're in a\n  position to use that patch as a template for the analogous changes needed to\n  support Android.</li>\n<li>We'll continue to work on generating patches to third-party projects to prove\n  that the tooling we've developed for mobile binary wheels is sufficient to\n  support the entire Python ecosystem. We're currently working on NumPy;\n  Cryptography will likely be the next project we look into.</li>\n<li>We will start the process of formalizing and standardizing the work that we've\n  done to support iOS and Android packaging. With PyCon US approaching rapidly,\n  we want to get these discussions underway so that we can make the most of the\n  opportunity provided by having a large portion of the Python community in one\n  place. There are two major areas that require formalization - the production\n  of official binaries for iOS and Android support; and the state of\n  cross-platform build environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the work we're doing on mobile binary wheels, we're expecting to\nwork on improving Briefcase, with a view to making Briefcase's tooling for\npackaging, signing and notarization useful as standalone utilities, without the\nneed to use Briefcase to package the entire app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longer-term-goals\">Longer term goals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#longer-term-goals\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The long term goals of BeeWare remain largely the same. Once we've developed a\ncompelling story for mobile binary packaging, we'll be able to turn our focus\nback to Toga. There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that\nneed to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common\ndevelopment patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare support\nchannels. Unless pull requests are submitted from the broader community, it is\nunlikely that we'll make any substantial progress on this front until the end of\nthis year, or perhaps early next year.</p>\n<p>We're also intending to look at tooling other than <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> for building\nBriefcase packages. Integration with Conda is one obvious goal, as it provides\nrich tooling for distributing complex binary requirements. <code>uv</code> is another tool\nthat might fit well in the Briefcase development story. Again, it is unlikely\nthat we'll make any progress on this front before the end of this year.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-28T03:57:42.230560+00:00", "date_published": "2025-04-03T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "russell@beeware.org (Russell Keith-Magee)"}], "tags": ["Buzz"]}, {"id": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/march-2025-status-update/", "url": "https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025/march-2025-status-update/", "title": "March 2025 Status Update", "content_html": "<p>March has seen a big release for Toga, and a number of other notable\nimprovements in the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"what-weve-done\">What we've done<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-weve-done\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.5.0/\">Toga 0.5.0 has been released</a>! It's\n  been over 5 months since our last feature release of Toga; this release\n  includes a number of major improvements to Toga's style layer, and some\n  significant improvements in iOS and macOS memory handling. This release\n  includes a number of backwards incompatible changes; check the <a href=\"https://toga.beeware.org/en/stable/about/releases/#backward-incompatible-changes_3\">Toga 0.5.0\n  release\n  notes</a>\n  for details.</li>\n<li>We added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3114\">Toga-Positron\n  bootstrap</a>. This bootstrap is a\n  Briefcase plugin that provides an easy way to start a new project that uses a\n  web browser as the primary UI. This is effectively the equivalent of\n  Electron-style apps - but the code is entirely written in Python, and works on\n  iOS and Android. It also allows for hybrid apps: as the underlying app is a\n  Toga app, you can mix Toga widgets into the layout that is being used. The\n  bootstrap allows you to convert a Django website or static web server into a\n  mobile app; it also provides a way to generate a \"single site browser\" -\n  converting a single public URL into a standalone app on your desktop.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3273\">modified the way that style properties are applied to Toga\n  widgets</a>.
