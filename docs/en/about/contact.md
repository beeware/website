If you have a general question about BeeWare usage, we have a number of
[community communication channels](/community/getting-help/) where you
can ask for assistance.

If you need advice on how to contribute, or you have questions about the
management of the project, anyone on the [Core Team](/about/team) will
be able to help you.

If you want to report a security problem with one of the BeeWare tools,
please contact the [Core Team](/about/team).

If you have had an uncomfortable experience in a BeeWare community space, or want
to report a behavior problem with someone who is a member of the
BeeWare community, the [Core Team](/about/team) will be happy to manage
your report in accordance with our [Code of Conduct reporting
guide](/community/behavior/making-a-coc-report/).
