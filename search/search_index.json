Python is rapidly becoming a major part of the data analysis, scientific computing, and web development landscape. And initiatives like Django Girls have demonstrated that using Python, it is possible to provide a 1-day training courses that introducing people with no programming experience to Python; and at the end of a day, attendees have developed and deployed a database-backed dynamic website, deployed to a publicly visible server.</p> <p>However, the developer experience for someone writing Python sometimes reflects more of the early 90's than the new millennium. The default development environment for Python is still an 80x25 console window. For users who have come from a Windows or Apple environment, where they're used to highly detailed, well-designed graphical interfaces, this 30 year flashback can be a completely alien experience.</p> <p>And, yes, there are IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that provide a native application experience for writing code. But those tools require you to adopt, wholesale, the IDE's way of looking at a project. They often introduce as many headaches to the development process as they solve.</p> <p>And so, we're left with an interesting schism, between the \"old way\" of Unix development in a console window, and the \"new way\" of all-in-one IDEs.</p>"},{"location":"about/history/#the-unix-philosophy","title":"The Unix Philosophy","text":"<p>However, it doesn't have to be that way. The core tenet of the Unix Philosophy is that \"each tool does one thing, well\". This is a very powerful philosophy, and it enables the composition of extremely powerful toolchains by putting together a suite of extremely focused, independent tools.</p> <p>Unfortunately, most UNIX tools have convolved this to also mean \"all tools must use a console interface\". However, there's nothing in the UNIX philosophy that says that tools have to use a console interface - it's just turned out that way.</p> <p>The BeeWare project started with the premise we can have the best of both worlds. We can have a chain of composable tools that each do one thing, well. But those tools can also expose their functionality using a rich graphical user interface.</p>"},{"location":"about/history/#more-than-just-code","title":"More than just code","text":"<p>It's about more than just code, though. A successful software project requires documentation, design skills, feedback and bug reports. The BeeWare community acknowledges that all contributions are important - not just the ones that come as a pull request on GitHub.</p> <p>Even then, it's easy to think of a project in a vacuum, as the sum of all contributions. But that's never the case. An open source project is about community.</p>"},{"location":"about/history/#diversity-and-inclusion","title":"Diversity and inclusion","text":"<p>A diverse community is a strong community. This means accepting people of all levels of experience, from all backgrounds, of all races, creeds, orientations and expressions. The BeeWare project is committed to developing and maintaining a inclusive, diverse and welcoming community.</p> <p>To back this up, we have an open offer to mentor anyone who wants to get involved as a contributor, and a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. Any reports of violations of that code of conduct - even by senior community members - will be treated with respect and acted upon appropriately.</p>"},{"location":"about/history/#healthy-and-sustainable","title":"Healthy and sustainable","text":"<p>It's also important to make sure that the community is accessible and sustainable. It's unfortunately become an accepted part of Open Source culture that \"true\" Open Source projects have to be developed entirely by volunteers. This acts as a barrier to entry for many groups - the only people able to spend their free time volunteering are those that have free time.</p> <p>It also frequently leads to burnout and other mental health issues amongst contributors. The fact that depression, anxiety, and burnout are so common in software development communities shouldn't be considered a badge of honor, or a demonstration of how committed a development team can be. It's a problem that needs to be tackled head on, and addressed in the same way a software bug would be addressed - with immediate workarounds, and long term plans to remove the systemic cause of the problem.</p> <p>While we place incredible value on the contributions of volunteers, we also know that volunteer efforts alone aren't the way to develop a healthy and sustainable community. For that reason, financial sustainability is a key consideration in the operation of the BeeWare project. As a community, we don't ignore the role that money has to play in providing the resources that allows people to begin and continue to contribute. We will, as a community, provide accepted mechanisms for individuals to monetize their work in meaningful ways, and wherever possible, compensate people for their work - without compromising the ideals of Open Source development.</p>"},{"location":"about/history/#the-goal","title":"The goal","text":"<p>The end goal of the BeeWare project: To be able to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that Django has done for web software - to put into the hands of users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices.

Python prides itself on being a cross-platform language. 10 years ago, being cross-platform meant being available for Windows, macOS and Linux. These days, mobile computing is much more important. Despite this, there aren't many good options for Python programming on mobile platforms, and cross-platform mobile coding is still elusive.</p> <p>BeeWare embraces mobile and other emerging platforms (like watches and set-top-boxes) as a first class citizen of the computing ecosystem - because if people have these devices, why shouldn't they be able to write software for them in Python.</p>"},{"location":"about/history/#native-everywhere","title":"Native everywhere","text":"<p>It's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. Widgets don't look quite right, or there's a menu bar on a window in an OS X app. Themes can get quite close - but there are always telltale signs.</p> <p>On top of that, native widgets are always faster than a themed generic widget. After all, you're using native system capability that has been tuned and optimized, not a drawing engine that's been layered on top of a generic widget.</p> <p>Themes also miss many of the accessibility benefits of native platforms. Modern OS authors spend a lot of time tuning affordances for people with impaired mobility, vision or cognition. If you use native widgets, you usually get these affordances for free. If you reimplement widgets with a theme, you also have to re-implement the affordances.</p> <p>BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development.</p>"},{"location":"about/history/#python-native","title":"Python native","text":"<p>BeeWare is also an unapologetically \"Python first\" framework. We like Python. We like the way it looks, and the way it works. If Python isn't available as a first-class option on a particular platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. That means we're going to use generators, context managers, <code>yield from</code> asynchronous calls, and more, in order to provide the best Python-native API for cross-platform app development.</p> <p>We're also looking to the future - this means that we support Python 3 exclusively.</p>"},{"location":"about/history/#native-experience","title":"Native experience","text":"<p>The experience of using any tool starts with the installation process. Part of BeeWare's \"Native everywhere\" philosophy is adopting appropriate native mechanisms for installation. If you're using a user-space tool, it should be presented to you as a package that is to be installed in the same way you would install any other tool - be that through an app store, an installer, or a simple executable package.

The cooldown period may be limited to particular communication channels or interactions with particular community members.</li> <li> <p>Repair: Examples of repair may include making an apology, using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about re-entering community spaces after the period is over.</p> </li> <li> <p>Temporary Suspension</p> </li> <li>Event: A pattern of repeated violation which the Response Team has tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.</li> <li>Consequence: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension.

The change note should be in Markdown format, in a file that has name of the format <code>&lt;id&gt;.&lt;fragment type&gt;.md</code>. If the change you are proposing will fix a bug or implement a feature for which there is an existing issue number, the ID will be the number of that ticket. If the change has no corresponding issue, the PR number can be used as the ID. You won't know this PR number until you push the pull request, so the first CI pass will fail the <code>towncrier</code> check; add the change note and push a PR update and CI should then pass.</p> <p>There are five fragment types:</p> <ul> <li><code>feature</code>: The PR adds a new behavior or capability that wasn't previously possible (e.g., adding support for a new packaging format, or a new feature in an existing packaging format);</li> <li><code>bugfix</code>: The PR fixes a bug in the existing implementation;</li> <li><code>doc</code>: The PR is a significant improvement to documentation;</li> <li><code>removal</code>; The PR represents a backwards incompatible change in the BeeWare API; or</li> <li><code>misc</code>; A minor or administrative change (e.g., fixing a typo, a minor language clarification, or updating a dependency version) that doesn't need to be announced in the release notes.</li> </ul> <p>This description in the change note should be a high level \"marketing\" summary of the change from the perspective of the user, not a deep technical description or implementation detail. It is distinct from a commit message - a commit message describes what has been done so that future developers can follow the reasoning for a change; the change note is a description for the benefit of users, who may not have knowledge of internals.</p> <p>For example, if you fix a bug related to project naming, the commit message might read:</p> <p>Apply stronger regular expression check to disallow project names that begin with digits.</p> <p>The corresponding change note would read something like:</p> <p>Project names can no longer begin with a number.</p> <p>Some PRs will introduce multiple features and fix multiple bugs, or introduce multiple backwards incompatible changes. In that case, the PR may have multiple change note files. If you need to associate two fragment types with the same ID, you can append a numerical suffix. For example, if PR 789 added a feature described by ticket 123, closed a bug described by ticket 234, and also made two backwards incompatible changes, you might have 4 change note files:</p> <ul> <li><code>123.feature.md</code></li> <li><code>234.bugfix.md</code></li> <li><code>789.removal.1.md</code></li> <li><code>789.removal.2.md</code></li> </ul> <p>For more information about <code>towncrier</code> and fragment types see News Fragments. You can also see existing examples of news fragments in the <code>changes</code> directory of the BeeWare repository. If this folder is empty, it's likely because BeeWare has recently published a new release; change note files are deleted and combined to update the release notes with each release.

The change note should be in Markdown format, in a file that has name of the format <code>&lt;id&gt;.&lt;fragment type&gt;.md</code>. If the change you are proposing will fix a bug or implement a feature for which there is an existing issue number, the ID will be the number of that ticket. If the change has no corresponding issue, the PR number can be used as the ID. You won't know this PR number until you push the pull request, so the first CI pass will fail the <code>towncrier</code> check; add the change note and push a PR update and CI should then pass.</p> <p>There are five fragment types:</p> <ul> <li><code>feature</code>: The PR adds a new behavior or capability that wasn't previously possible (e.g., adding support for a new packaging format, or a new feature in an existing packaging format);</li> <li><code>bugfix</code>: The PR fixes a bug in the existing implementation;</li> <li><code>doc</code>: The PR is a significant improvement to documentation;</li> <li><code>removal</code>; The PR represents a backwards incompatible change in the BeeWare API; or</li> <li><code>misc</code>; A minor or administrative change (e.g., fixing a typo, a minor language clarification, or updating a dependency version) that doesn't need to be announced in the release notes.</li> </ul> <p>This description in the change note should be a high level \"marketing\" summary of the change from the perspective of the user, not a deep technical description or implementation detail. It is distinct from a commit message - a commit message describes what has been done so that future developers can follow the reasoning for a change; the change note is a description for the benefit of users, who may not have knowledge of internals.</p> <p>For example, if you fix a bug related to project naming, the commit message might read:</p> <p>Apply stronger regular expression check to disallow project names that begin with digits.</p> <p>The corresponding change note would read something like:</p> <p>Project names can no longer begin with a number.</p> <p>Some PRs will introduce multiple features and fix multiple bugs, or introduce multiple backwards incompatible changes. In that case, the PR may have multiple change note files. If you need to associate two fragment types with the same ID, you can append a numerical suffix. For example, if PR 789 added a feature described by ticket 123, closed a bug described by ticket 234, and also made two backwards incompatible changes, you might have 4 change note files:</p> <ul> <li><code>123.feature.md</code></li> <li><code>234.bugfix.md</code></li> <li><code>789.removal.1.md</code></li> <li><code>789.removal.2.md</code></li> </ul> <p>For more information about <code>towncrier</code> and fragment types see News Fragments. You can also see existing examples of news fragments in the <code>changes</code> directory of the BeeWare repository. If this folder is empty, it's likely because BeeWare has recently published a new release; change note files are deleted and combined to update the release notes with each release. You can look at that file to see the style of comment that is required; you can look at recently merged PRs to see how to format your change notes.</p> Submit a pull request <p>Now that you've committed all your changes, you're ready to submit a pull request.

By default, when you clone your repository fork, you'll be checked out on your <code>main</code> branch. This is a direct copy of BeeWare's <code>main</code> branch.</p> <p>While you can submit a pull request from your <code>main</code> branch, it's preferable if you don't do this. If you submit a pull request that is almost right, the core team member who reviews your pull request may be able to make the necessary changes, rather than giving feedback asking for a minor change. However, if you submit your pull request from your <code>main</code> branch, reviewers are prevented from making modifications.</p> <p>Working off your main branch also makes it difficult for you after you complete your first pull request. If you want to work on a second pull request, you will need to have a \"clean\" copy of the upstream project's main branch on which to base your second contribution; if you've made your first contribution from your <code>main</code> branch, you no longer have that clean version available.</p> <p>Instead, you should make your changes on a feature branch. A feature branch has a simple name to identify the change that you've made. For example, if you're fixing a bug that causes build issues on Windows 11, you might create a feature branch <code>fix-win11-build</code>. If your bug relates to a specific issue that has been reported, it's also common to reference that issue number in the branch name (e.g., <code>fix-1234</code>).</p> <p>To create a <code>fix-win11-build</code> feature branch, run:</p> macOSLinuxWindows <pre><code>(.venv) $ git switch -c fix-win11-build\n</code></pre> <pre><code>(.venv) $ git switch -c fix-win11-build\n</code></pre> <pre><code>(.venv) C:\\...&gt;git switch -c fix-win11-build\n</code></pre> Avoid scope creep <p>\"Scope creep\" happens when the list of problems resolved or features implemented by a single contribution grows significantly beyond what was intended when the work began. You start with a simple issue; you discover a closely related problem, and decide to include that fix as well; then a third\u2026 before you know it, you've got a pull request that closes 5 issues and adds 3 new features, including dozens of files.</p> <p>Scope creep happens to everyone. It is a concept that is all too familiar to seasoned developers; we've all done it multiple times, and experienced all the issues that come with it.</p> <p>There are very practical reasons to avoid scope creep. The larger a contribution gets, the more difficult it is to work with. It becomes harder to identify edge cases or potential problems, which means overall quality of the contribution may be diminished. Reviews also become more challenging when the reviewer needs to deal with multiple, potentially unrelated, contexts. A larger contribution means more review comments, and as a contributor, it can become difficult to follow multiple review threads. Even your GitHub experience will suffer - GitHub's UI will slow down as the size of a PR grows, meaning navigating the files through the GitHub interface and attempting to leave review comments becomes increasingly difficult.</p> <p>Any time you find a reason to add anything to your contribution that isn't explicitly part of the original proposal or bug report, you should consider whether you're heading into scope creep. Are there two distinct features that could be implemented separately? Could a feature be implemented with a known limitation or bug, and that bug fixed in a follow-up pull request? Is one part of a bug fix independent of another? If part of a change can be left out without altering the original contribution, it probably should be.</p> <p>Developing software is always a process of incremental improvement. Each individual contribution should leave the code base in a better state as a result of being merged, but it's entirely acceptable to leave bugs or parts of features as work for future improvement. That might mean breaking a pull request into multiple parts that can be reviewed independently, or logging an issue so that someone else can investigate and resolve the problem.</p> <p>Limiting the scope of each contribution helps everyone involved, including you. Your reviewers, and even you, will appreciate it.</p> Implement the new feature <p>Fixing a bug or implementing a feature will require you to write some new code.</p> <p>We have a code style guide that outlines our guidelines for writing code for BeeWare.</p> Build documentation <p>Before making any changes to BeeWare's documentation, it is helpful to confirm that you can build the existing documentation.</p> <p>You must have a Python 3.13 interpreter installed and available on your path (i.e., <code>python3.13</code> must start a Python 3.13 interpreter).</p> <p>BeeWare uses <code>tox</code> for building documentation. The following <code>tox</code> commands must be run from the same location as the <code>tox.ini</code> file, which is in the root directory of the project.</p> Write documentation <p>These are the steps to follow to write your documentation contribution to BeeWare.</p> Add a change note <p>Many BeeWare tools use <code>towncrier</code> to assist in building the release notes for each release. When you submit a pull request to one of the applicable tools, it will need to include a change note - this change note will become the entry in the release notes describing the change that has been made.</p> <p>Every pull request must include at least one file in the <code>changes/</code> directory that provides a short description of the change implemented by the pull request. The change note should be in Markdown format, in a file that has name of the format <code>&lt;id&gt;.&lt;fragment type&gt;.md</code>. If the change you are proposing will fix a bug or implement a feature for which there is an existing issue number, the ID will be the number of that ticket. If the change has no corresponding issue, the PR number can be used as the ID. You won't know this PR number until you push the pull request, so the first CI pass will fail the <code>towncrier</code> check; add the change note and push a PR update and CI should then pass.</p> <p>There are five fragment types:</p> <ul> <li><code>feature</code>: The PR adds a new behavior or capability that wasn't previously possible (e.g., adding support for a new packaging format, or a new feature in an existing packaging format);</li> <li><code>bugfix</code>: The PR fixes a bug in the existing implementation;</li> <li><code>doc</code>: The PR is a significant improvement to documentation;</li> <li><code>removal</code>; The PR represents a backwards incompatible change in the BeeWare API; or</li> <li><code>misc</code>; A minor or administrative change (e.g., fixing a typo, a minor language clarification, or updating a dependency version) that doesn't need to be announced in the release notes.</li> </ul> <p>This description in the change note should be a high level \"marketing\" summary of the change from the perspective of the user, not a deep technical description or implementation detail. It is distinct from a commit message - a commit message describes what has been done so that future developers can follow the reasoning for a change; the change note is a description for the benefit of users, who may not have knowledge of internals.</p> <p>For example, if you fix a bug related to project naming, the commit message might read:</p> <p>Apply stronger regular expression check to disallow project names that begin with digits.</p> <p>The corresponding change note would read something like:</p> <p>Project names can no longer begin with a number.</p> <p>Some PRs will introduce multiple features and fix multiple bugs, or introduce multiple backwards incompatible changes. In that case, the PR may have multiple change note files. If you need to associate two fragment types with the same ID, you can append a numerical suffix. For example, if PR 789 added a feature described by ticket 123, closed a bug described by ticket 234, and also made two backwards incompatible changes, you might have 4 change note files:</p> <ul> <li><code>123.feature.md</code></li> <li><code>234.bugfix.md</code></li> <li><code>789.removal.1.md</code></li> <li><code>789.removal.2.md</code></li> </ul> <p>For more information about <code>towncrier</code> and fragment types see News Fragments. You can also see existing examples of news fragments in the <code>changes</code> directory of the BeeWare repository. If this folder is empty, it's likely because BeeWare has recently published a new release; change note files are deleted and combined to update the release notes with each release. You can look at that file to see the style of comment that is required; you can look at recently merged PRs to see how to format your change notes.</p> Submit a pull request <p>Now that you've committed all your changes, you're ready to submit a pull request.

By default, when you clone your repository fork, you'll be checked out on your <code>main</code> branch. This is a direct copy of BeeWare's <code>main</code> branch.</p> <p>While you can submit a pull request from your <code>main</code> branch, it's preferable if you don't do this. If you submit a pull request that is almost right, the core team member who reviews your pull request may be able to make the necessary changes, rather than giving feedback asking for a minor change. However, if you submit your pull request from your <code>main</code> branch, reviewers are prevented from making modifications.</p> <p>Working off your main branch also makes it difficult for you after you complete your first pull request. If you want to work on a second pull request, you will need to have a \"clean\" copy of the upstream project's main branch on which to base your second contribution; if you've made your first contribution from your <code>main</code> branch, you no longer have that clean version available.</p> <p>Instead, you should make your changes on a feature branch. A feature branch has a simple name to identify the change that you've made. For example, if you're fixing a bug that causes build issues on Windows 11, you might create a feature branch <code>fix-win11-build</code>. If your bug relates to a specific issue that has been reported, it's also common to reference that issue number in the branch name (e.g., <code>fix-1234</code>).</p> <p>To create a <code>fix-win11-build</code> feature branch, run:</p> macOSLinuxWindows <pre><code>(.venv) $ git switch -c fix-win11-build\n</code></pre> <pre><code>(.venv) $ git switch -c fix-win11-build\n</code></pre> <pre><code>(.venv) C:\\...&gt;git switch -c fix-win11-build\n</code></pre> Avoid scope creep <p>\"Scope creep\" happens when the list of problems resolved or features implemented by a single contribution grows significantly beyond what was intended when the work began. You start with a simple issue; you discover a closely related problem, and decide to include that fix as well; then a third\u2026 before you know it, you've got a pull request that closes 5 issues and adds 3 new features, including dozens of files.</p> <p>Scope creep happens to everyone. It is a concept that is all too familiar to seasoned developers; we've all done it multiple times, and experienced all the issues that come with it.</p> <p>There are very practical reasons to avoid scope creep. The larger a contribution gets, the more difficult it is to work with. It becomes harder to identify edge cases or potential problems, which means overall quality of the contribution may be diminished. Reviews also become more challenging when the reviewer needs to deal with multiple, potentially unrelated, contexts. A larger contribution means more review comments, and as a contributor, it can become difficult to follow multiple review threads. Even your GitHub experience will suffer - GitHub's UI will slow down as the size of a PR grows, meaning navigating the files through the GitHub interface and attempting to leave review comments becomes increasingly difficult.</p> <p>Any time you find a reason to add anything to your contribution that isn't explicitly part of the original proposal or bug report, you should consider whether you're heading into scope creep. Are there two distinct features that could be implemented separately? Could a feature be implemented with a known limitation or bug, and that bug fixed in a follow-up pull request? Is one part of a bug fix independent of another? If part of a change can be left out without altering the original contribution, it probably should be.</p> <p>Developing software is always a process of incremental improvement. Each individual contribution should leave the code base in a better state as a result of being merged, but it's entirely acceptable to leave bugs or parts of features as work for future improvement. That might mean breaking a pull request into multiple parts that can be reviewed independently, or logging an issue so that someone else can investigate and resolve the problem.</p> <p>Limiting the scope of each contribution helps everyone involved, including you. Your reviewers, and even you, will appreciate it.</p> Building documentation <p>Before making any changes to BeeWare's documentation, it is helpful to confirm that you can build the existing documentation.</p> <p>You must have a Python 3.13 interpreter installed and available on your path (i.e., <code>python3.13</code> must start a Python 3.13 interpreter).</p> <p>BeeWare uses <code>tox</code> for building documentation. The following <code>tox</code> commands must be run from the same location as the <code>tox.ini</code> file, which is in the root directory of the project.</p> Writing documentation <p>These are the steps to follow to write your documentation contribution to BeeWare.</p> Add a change note <p>Many BeeWare tools use <code>towncrier</code> to assist in building the release notes for each release. When you submit a pull request to one of the applicable tools, it will need to include a change note - this change note will become the entry in the release notes describing the change that has been made.</p> <p>Every pull request must include at least one file in the <code>changes/</code> directory that provides a short description of the change implemented by the pull request. The change note should be in Markdown format, in a file that has name of the format <code>&lt;id&gt;.&lt;fragment type&gt;.md</code>. If the change you are proposing will fix a bug or implement a feature for which there is an existing issue number, the ID will be the number of that ticket. If the change has no corresponding issue, the PR number can be used as the ID. You won't know this PR number until you push the pull request, so the first CI pass will fail the <code>towncrier</code> check; add the change note and push a PR update and CI should then pass.</p> <p>There are five fragment types:</p> <ul> <li><code>feature</code>: The PR adds a new behavior or capability that wasn't previously possible (e.g., adding support for a new packaging format, or a new feature in an existing packaging format);</li> <li><code>bugfix</code>: The PR fixes a bug in the existing implementation;</li> <li><code>doc</code>: The PR is a significant improvement to documentation;</li> <li><code>removal</code>; The PR represents a backwards incompatible change in the BeeWare API; or</li> <li><code>misc</code>; A minor or administrative change (e.g., fixing a typo, a minor language clarification, or updating a dependency version) that doesn't need to be announced in the release notes.</li> </ul> <p>This description in the change note should be a high level \"marketing\" summary of the change from the perspective of the user, not a deep technical description or implementation detail. It is distinct from a commit message - a commit message describes what has been done so that future developers can follow the reasoning for a change; the change note is a description for the benefit of users, who may not have knowledge of internals.</p> <p>For example, if you fix a bug related to project naming, the commit message might read:</p> <p>Apply stronger regular expression check to disallow project names that begin with digits.</p> <p>The corresponding change note would read something like:</p> <p>Project names can no longer begin with a number.</p> <p>Some PRs will introduce multiple features and fix multiple bugs, or introduce multiple backwards incompatible changes. In that case, the PR may have multiple change note files. If you need to associate two fragment types with the same ID, you can append a numerical suffix. For example, if PR 789 added a feature described by ticket 123, closed a bug described by ticket 234, and also made two backwards incompatible changes, you might have 4 change note files:</p> <ul> <li><code>123.feature.md</code></li> <li><code>234.bugfix.md</code></li> <li><code>789.removal.1.md</code></li> <li><code>789.removal.2.md</code></li> </ul> <p>For more information about <code>towncrier</code> and fragment types see News Fragments. You can also see existing examples of news fragments in the <code>changes</code> directory of the BeeWare repository. If this folder is empty, it's likely because BeeWare has recently published a new release; change note files are deleted and combined to update the release notes with each release. You can look at that file to see the style of comment that is required; you can look at recently merged PRs to see how to format your change notes.</p> Submit a pull request <p>Now that you've committed all your changes, you're ready to submit a pull request.

If applicable, you should also include any research you have done on how your idea would manifest on different platforms.</p> <p>Once the Discussion thread is opened, the BeeWare team and the rest of the community will respond. The core team will aim to provide at least an initial impression of your idea within two business days. If an idea is especially complex, a more detailed analysis might take up to a week. Events like holidays and conferences might cause those timelines to be slightly longer.</p> <p>This is your opportunity to participate in a conversation about your idea.

There may be technical reasons it can't be implemented. For example, we might reject an idea if:</p> <ul> <li>It would be difficult or impossible to implement reliably across all supported platforms; or</li> <li>It would be difficult to maintain, or maintenance would require access to technology or software that isn't widely available; or</li> <li>It serves a niche audience, but imposes significant overhead on other users.</li> </ul> <p>If we determine that your idea isn't a good fit, it doesn't necessarily mean you should give up on it. While we may reject a specific idea, we may be a lot more amenable to adding a plugin interface or other extension point that would allow you to maintain the same feature as an external library.

The talk was a summary of the issues around one of the biggest problems that I see facing the open source community: how to provide the resources that are needed to develop and maintain the software that we, as a community depend upon. This means providing maintenance and support for established projects, large and small; but also providing an ecosystem where new ideas can be incubated, developed and matured until they present compelling alternatives or significant benefits over closed source offerings.</p> <p>It's been almost 18 months since I first presented this talk, but the issue persists. I haven't been alone in noticing and drawing attention to this issue, either. Nadia Eghbal was commissioned to write a white paper for the Ford Foundation entitled Roads and Bridges highlighting the chronic need for resources to support the basic infrastructure that underpins large parts of the modern economy. Eric Holscher (maintainer of Read the Docs) blogged about the problems he's had raising funds, despite the fact that the service he delivers is a widely used - arguably indispensable - part of the Python ecosystem.</p> <p>However, despite this attention, it still doesn't get anywhere near as much attention as it should. And it's an issue that is of pressing importance to me, as the BeeWare project is looking for ways to fund the development needed to take us from \"interesting technical demo\" to \"compelling technical solution\".</p> <p>A few months back, it was suggested that I should publish a blog post to accompany the video presentation. I dragged my feet on doing this, until industrious BeeWare contributor and all-around nice guy Elias Dorneles offered to take my speakers notes and convert it into a transcript.</p> <p>So - here it is. Money Money Money: Writing software, in a rich (wo)man's world.

We\u2019re a Software as a Service for tradespeople \u2013 plumbers, electricians, carpenters and the like. TradesCloud depends on a number of open source projects - Django, Apache, memcache, countless others. So I've got a business interest in the continuity of these open source projects - but I certainly don't have the resources to fund them all myself.</p> <p>I've also got a declared interest in GUI/UI issues, especially as they relate to development tools. I've got grand visions of what I'd like to do with this project, and I've received some great contributions from the community, but it's still largely my own work. But my startup would be able to make great use of these tools if they were mature.</p> <p>I've also a maintainer of some smaller projects, like the Python wrapper to the Xero API. I started the project because I had an itch; and my itch has been scratched. But now I've open sourced that project, which means I've inherited a maintenance task. I've accepted help from a couple of people - most notably Matthew Schinkel and Aidan Lister, who have done great work. But if I'm honest, the maintenance burden of PyXero well exceeds the time I can reasonably dedicate to it.</p> <p>So - I've got vested interests in free software. I've got an interest as a producer of a successful project with a high profile; as the producer of a small project with lots of users but little personal incentive; and as a producer of smaller projects with almost no profile but grand plans. These projects all have different resourcing needs, reflecting their maturity as projects.</p> <p>I've also got interests as a consumer of free software - both in terms of the software I rely on to develop my own projects, and in terms of my commercial interest in the long term maintenance of tools and platforms. I need these projects to continue to develop, survive and thrive.</p> <p>Based on my experience, I'd like to make a bold assertion:</p> <p>Absent of any other constraints, given equivalent resources, the free software approach produces vastly superior engineering outcomes than the closed-source approach.</p> <p>The catch is the operative clause \"given equivalent resources\". Most free software projects aren't developed using anything close to \"equivalent\" resources.</p> <p>In some cases, this is a blessing in disguise - regardless of the project, having scarce resources is an excellent crucible for burning away the unnecessary to leave only the base metal. But it's not always a blessing.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#the-moral-high-road-is-littered-with-the-corpses-of-our-allies","title":"The moral high road is littered with the corpses of our allies","text":"<p>Talk to any prominent free software developer, and amongst the success stories, you'll also hear some consistent troubles - that they've got great ideas and grand plans, but no time to execute; that they're about to burn out due to the pressures of maintaining their project; or that they've had yet another mailing list discussion with someone who doesn't understand why you didn't drop everything to help them fix their problem. And there are plenty of examples.</p> <p>OpenSSL is the software that drives pretty much every \"secure\" connection on the internet - and yet it took until the discovery of Heartbleed - a critical vulnerability that sent the internet into a tailspin - before it could find funding to pay for maintainers.</p> <p>Another example - GnuPG - Werner Koch almost went bankrupt trying to support GPG - a project that many others depends upon for trust in their release process. He was rescued, at deaths door, by the Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure initiative.</p> <p>Those are both examples that ended with funding; but it's not all happy endings.</p> <p>Take the example of Capistrano. Hugely popular configuration management tool around 2007-8, maintained by Jamis Buck. In 2008, citing burnout and maintenance overhead, he famously withdrew support for Windows, saying \"Windows may be the 800 pounds gorilla in the room, but it's not my gorilla, and it's not in my room\". This was an incredibly unpopular move; but even with that scale down, Jamis burned out in 2009, abandoning Capistrano, and a number of other projects, without maintainers.</p> <p>\"Hi I'm an engineer at a well-funded company and we need this feature can someone implement it for free?\" -- Every FOSS mailing list.</p>\u2014 Christophe (@Xof) July 17, 2015 <p>The thing is - that this is a community that has lots of cash. In the grand scheme of things, software development is a well funded industry. If companies can find money for foosball tables and meditative ball pits, they should be able to find resources to help maintain the software on which they've based their success. And if you're on the receiving end of the problem - a developer of free software - that can be really frustrating.</p> <p>For me, this is the great unanswered question of the free software movement - how to reconcile the discrepancy between the clear demand for a software product, and the ability to convert that demand into the time and resources needed to service that demand.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#free-software-dream-vs-reality","title":"Free software: Dream vs Reality","text":"<p>Although the theory says that anyone can contribute to a free software project, in reality, every single project of any significance has leaders.

The running gag is that a camel is a horse designed by committee. The worst APIs we deal with on a daily basis are the ones that were designed by committee. You need someone with taste running the show.</p> <p>But there's a bigger problem - there's the extent of the engagement that users have with a project. Here's a though experiment to prove my point. We're in a room full of Python users. Django is a free software project.</p> <ul> <li>Who in this room has found a bug in Django, or has a niggling thing they'd like to see fixed Django API?</li> <li>Who has turned that niggle into a bug report to Django?</li> <li>Who has submitted a patch to Django for that niggle?</li> <li>Of those, who have had that patch committed?</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>When this is done in front of a live audience, at each question, there are fewer people raising their hands.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#products-vs-projects","title":"Products vs Projects","text":"<p>So what's going on here? Well, it reflects 2 different ways of looking at a piece of software - Projects and Products. And it's a matter of personal perspective - my project can be your product, and vice versa.</p> <p>When I view some code as a project, it's a body of code where I'm contributing to a larger goal. I'm willing to spend resources focussing on other people's needs in the hope that their needs will help make the project as a whole better. I'm willing to do this because I get some personal gain, like an enhanced public profile; or if the tool is really close to my work coalface; or where I know I can make a substantive contribution.</p> <p>But the further I get away from my coalface, and the harder it is to make a contribution, the less inclined I am to even want to contribute to the project. Most of the time, it's a product that I'm using, warts and all. If a product has bugs, I'll work around them, or find an alternative, rather than navigating the contribution process and contributing a patch back upstream.</p> <p>In the case of a product, the freedoms afforded by Free software are a bit like freedom of speech - it's a freedom I definitely want, it's comforting to know it's there, but I don't spend every day making sure that I fully exploit the extents of those freedoms. There are people who do - protestors, advocates for controversial social positions - and one day, given the right circumstances, I might join in and help them. But most of the time, I just want to be pragmatic, and get on with living.</p> <p>This dichotomy between the theory and practice is also the reason why comments like \"Patches Welcome\" get made in Free software mailing lists. On the one hand, it's completely correct. Anyone can contribute, and on most projects patches are welcome. But most people don't look at a new open source project as an opportunity to engage and contribute. Most people just want to use the damn software.</p> <p>And you can argue it's because people are focussing on the wrong interpretation of \"free\", and haven't \"captured the spirit of free software\". Which is 100% true, but utterly counterproductive as a position. Anyone who has done any UX work knows that if users are consistently making a mistake, blaming the user gets you nowhere. You were in charge of what the user experienced, and they made the \"error\" because of a fundamental cognitive disconnect.</p> <p>And even if everyone did get the right message - let's be realistic - it wouldn't work anyway. The mythical man month showed us that you don't deliver a project faster or better by throwing more people at it. 9 women can't make a baby in 1 month - a project doesn't just need resources - it needs the right resources, in the right quantities. And ultimately, that means projects finding a way to get the resources they need to be self-sustaining.</p> <p>So, that means that if we want free software to be maintained, and maintained well, we need to find a way to fund it's maintenance.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#use-value-vs-sale-value","title":"Use value vs Sale value","text":"<p>18 years ago, Eric S Raymond published an essay entitled \"Cathedral and the Bazaar\". This essay catalyzed the start of the open source movement - a redefinition of \"free software\" to make it clear that the openness, not price, was the important property. What isn't as well remembered is that \"Cathedral and the Bazaar\" isn't the only essay Raymond wrote at that time. He published 2 other essays shortly after CatB - \"Homesteading the Noosphere\", about the social organization and motivations behind free software projects, and The Magic Cauldron, about the economics of Free software.</p> <p>One of the key distinctions that Raymond highlights in that essay is the difference between Use value and Sale value.</p> <p>The sale value of a product is its value as a salable commodity - literally, what you sell it for.</p> <p>The use value of a product is its economic value as a tool, as a productivity multiplier. This is how much economic benefit the user will get from the product.</p> <p>The important the is that the two aren't necessarily connected. In a traditional manufacturing environment, the focus is on sale value, because that's usually linked to the manufacturing cost - the cost of parts and materials.</p> <p>But most software isn't produced for sale value - it's in house software produced for use value. In the case of free software, the \"sale\" value for free software is 0. But that doesn't mean there isn't use value, and the catch is to work out how to exploit the use value that exists within an organization as a monetization channel.</p> <p>So, what are your options?</p> <p>Well, you can sell merchandise. And while this is relatively easy to do, lets be honest - you're not going to fund a software empire selling t-shirts.</p> <p>You can get users to pay for documentation. Write a book, get users to pay for it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the dirty little secret of the tech writing scene is that nobody gets rich writing tech books. They're incredibly valuable resources for the community, they're great for padding your resume, but not so great as a revenue stream.</p> <p>One area that does pay well is selling training. Employers are willing to pay big bucks for training courses; if you can put together a 3 day intensive workshop, you can sell it over and over again.</p> <p>You can productize your offering. The source code remains free, but a simple, easy-to-use installer costs money. This works really great when what you have is a clearly identifiable product - like an IDE.</p> <p>One specific model of productization is SaaS - give the code away for free, but pay for the convenience of having someone else administer it for you. Any open source web software is a good example of this - you can install the software on your own servers, but honestly, unless you've got a reason, you use someone else's hosted solution and let them take care of it for you.</p> <p>But, SaaS is only viable if you can deliver as a service - which means it's really only viable for web. And, as technologies like docker commodify deployment, it's possible that even this revenue stream might evaporate.</p> <p>So what else can you sell?</p> <p>You can sell access to the developers. If you're the maintainer of a project, you're in the best position to provide support, or debug complex problems - which means you're in a prime position to sell support and consulting. Honza Kr\u00e1l https://twitter.com/honzakral from ElasticSearch calls this the \"Ghostbusters\" business model - \"Who you gonna call?\"</p> <p>You can sell access to the software. Trolltech did this with Qt; Riverbank still does with the PyQt bindings. The library itself is GPL - but if you want to use it on a closed source project, you can, for a hefty fee. This has the advantage that it forces commercial interests to pay for what they're using; but it also discourages small scale commercial tinkering - if I'm writing a new tool, and I'm forced to choose between open sourcing my tool or a $1000 price tag, I'll probably choose a different toolkit.</p> <p>You can also get into the business of providing certifications and guarantees - auditing code to ensure quality or compatibility, providing guarantees about fixing bugs, and certifying that individuals are skilled in the use of the product. This is a big part of Red Hat's business model - auditing packages, making sure they all interoperate as expected, ensuring that security updates are available and meet the same standards, and certifying system administrators.</p> <p>This is a set of products that appeals to the \"enterprise\" high end of town - and that's is a lucrative end of the market. But those customers also tend to only want these guarantees for certain types of software - broadly speaking, \"Boring fuddy-duddy\" software. Your operating system, your database - these are pieces of software that need to be rock solid in an enterprise setting. Your debug toolbar - not so much, unless maybe they've being wrapped as part of a suite of tools.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#undermining-your-value-proposition","title":"Undermining your value proposition","text":"<p>Another problem with many of these revenue sources is that if you run your project well, a lot of them are ruled out - or at least severely curtailed.</p> <p>If you make something truly simple to use, you've just removed the need for books and training courses - or, at the very least, moved the ground to \"advanced\" courses - which are harder to write, and have a smaller audience.</p> <p>Django saw this first hand - Django's documentation was famously very good from a very early stage, and as a result, it was quite hard to get publishers to take on Django book projects - because the documentation was too good, and was undermining the market for books. It's taken a long time, and mostly self-publishing, to get good Django books available for sale.</p> <p>If you have a project mailing list, where the community answers questions for free, and it's a healthy, responsive mailing list\u2026 why would I pay for support?</p> <p>If your software is well designed, and modular, and those interfaces are well documented, and I need a modification - why wouldn't I just write the mod myself?</p> <p>Now, OK - I'm exaggerating. There are legitimate reasons to pay for support or to bring in a consultant even if the interfaces are clean and well documented. But my point is that the better you do a job as a free software engineer, it becomes harder to make the business case for your revenue stream, because the value proposition becomes less obvious.</p> <p>And if it isn't directly undermining your value proposition, it can still undermine you indirectly, because the more time you spend earning money, the less you spend doing what the money pays for. Administering a certification program takes time. Writing and delivering training courses takes time. Consulting can be lucrative, but developing a sales pipeline takes time. And if you're consulting, you need to make sure that sales pipeline is full, which means you're going to err on the side of taking on more work than less\u2026 which means you've just closed the door on the the time you have available to work on open source.</p> <p>You also need to be careful that in selling your business case, you don't undermine your main project. If every hard question on the mailing list is answered \"We can answer that for a fee\", you're going to sound like a shill.</p> <p>If a project says it needs money to make sure we stay on top of security issues\u2026 you have to be really careful how you say it, because the easy interpretation is \"well, the project must be insecure, because they're not on top of security now\".</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#a-question-of-scale","title":"A question of scale","text":"<p>There's also a question of scale.

Or training and certification in its use?</p> <p>Smaller projects are no less important to the vitality of the overall Django ecosystem, but those projects aren't afforded the same opportunities for fundraising as larger projects.</p> <p>It's also important to realize that not all products are afforded all these opportunities for revenue.

Platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide a way to a group of people to pitch in and contribute to a goal.</p> <p>The Django community has a couple of examples of very successful crowdfunding projects, each raising tens of thousands of dollars (Django Migrations, Multiple Template engines, django.contrib.postgres, Django Rest Framework). But - if you survey the people who did these projects, they didn't make money on these projects. The amount of engineering time that went into them well exceeded the money raised.</p> <p>Another idea that gets floated regularly is the idea of bug bounties - placing a price on specific bugs. This is really just another form of crowdfunding - You want a specific bug fixed or feature added? Contribute money. You really want it - contribute more. And eventually someone will take the bait and fix the bug or implement the feature.</p> <p>It's an attractive model - but it also has problems - most notably, Who gets paid. Do you pay by lines of code written? That ignores the contribution of reviewers. How much more important than writing code is reviewing code or triaging a bug?</p> <p>But the biggest problem I see with crowdfunding approaches is that they are in conflict with establishing a working income. If you're hiring yourself out, the shorter the engagement, the higher your hourly rate. This is a hedge against unemployment at the end of the contract. If you're doing a Kickstarter, you're best served by having a small, clearly described, clearly achievable goal. So - a month or two of work.</p> <p>That means you need to charge your short term rate in order to guarantee long term income. But it's also in your interest to have a low fundraising target, so that the campaign actually tips. If it's too high, it could scare off potential bidders. It also means the community pays a premium for any new feature, which isn't the best use of already scarce community resources.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#grants-fellowships-patreon","title":"Grants, Fellowships, Patreon","text":"<p>OK - so if you want longer term income, you need to look at longer term engagements. That means that you stop looking at funding specific projects, and start looking at funding the person, with grants and fellowship positions.</p> <p>I'm including Patreon in that list because it's effectively \"crowdsourced patronage\". You're not paying for a specific thing - it's \"keep doing what you're doing\" money.</p> <p>Over the last 10 months, Django has been using this model. We hired a fellow at the end of last year. The fellow - whose name is Tim Graham - is responsible for keeping the project wheels greased.</p> <p>From a technical perspective, this has been a roaring success. Tim's made great inroads into our ticket backlog, and response times on ticket reviews are lower than they've ever been.</p> <p>The hard part has been raising the money to pay him.</p> <p>We did a fundraiser at the start of the year specifically to fund the Fellow; that campaign has raised just over $50k US. That's no small chunk of change - but it's also not a lot when you're talking about a full time employee. We're going to need to do another fundraiser really soon if the Fellowship is going to continue.</p> <p>Almost everyone agrees it's been money well spent, but converting that into donations has been hard work.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#corporate-sponsorship","title":"Corporate sponsorship","text":"<p>Another other approach for raising money is to embrace the devil, and go commercial. Commercial interests have the money, so why shouldn't they pay for it? This can be very successful under certain circumstances - but you have to be able to make a business case for the corporate owner.</p> <p>OpenStack is a great example of this. Why are Rackspace, HP, Red Hat, Ubuntu all interested in OpenStack? Because they sell products that benefit from commodifying the hosting environment. By making it cheap and easy to control cloud deployments, they increase the size of the market for cloud hosting, which means more money for their core business - either directly (like Rackspace), or indirectly (like Red Hat, because cloud servers still need operating systems).</p> <p>Node.js is funded by Joyent for similar reasons - Joyent is making a long play that if it's easier to develop web software, more people will write web software, increasing the market for Joyent's services.</p> <p>However, Node.js is also a cautionary tale about corporate interests - what happens when the community and the corporate sponsor disagree about the direction of the project? Well, you get project splits, like the io.js split. Corporate money can corrupt. You need to be careful that project governance is independent of the funding source.</p> <p>Having a single corporate master also puts the project the risk if that corporate master loses interest. Django was originally under the wing of the World Company. Eventually, that interest waned, and the corporate support dried up, too.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#venture-funding","title":"Venture funding","text":"<p>The other corporate answer that gets floated is to go get venture money. And there are some examples out there of people doing this. Meteor, for example, is funding their development with money from a venture fund. They've got plenty of money to hire engineers, designers - whatever they need.</p> <p>What makes me nervous about this model? We've been here before. Who here remembers Eazel? For those who don't remember, In the late 90s, Eazel was a dot-com company founded to develop the Nautilus file manager. And, we got 2 years of open source code. And then the bubble burst, and the company went bust. Now, the good thing is that we still have the code. But it would be better to have the code still being actively developed.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#developing-a-patronage-culture","title":"Developing a patronage culture","text":"<p>And again, all this discussion is happening in an industry where billion dollar valuations are kicking around.</p> <p>Large parts of our industry, are built on a foundation of FOSS - but those with the most capacity to contribute, in many cases, aren't contributing.</p> <p>Some are - there are some companies that do give huge amounts back to open source communities. But there are also a lot of companies that don't give back.</p> <p>And even those that do give back - many of them give the help they're able to give, which isn't necessarily the help that is needed. The Django Software Foundation regularly receives offers for free or subsidized hosting from hosting providers. And don't get me wrong - that's great, and incredibly useful.</p> <p>But what we really need is someone on the payroll to review bugs. Earlier on in the lifecycle of Django, we needed people to write new big features. We're in a constant need of graphic designers, artists, tech writers. We need people who know how to do sysadmin, and community outreach. And we don't need 400 people donating 1 hour; we need 10 very specific people donating 40 hours.</p> <p>When a disaster hits, organizations like the Red Cross call for donations. And they will usually say \"please give us money, not tins of food or blankets\". The reason? Money can buy what is needed. You can't control what people donate, and even if they do happen to donate exactly what you need, there's a huge logistic task of working out what has been donated, and getting it where it's needed.</p> <p>FOSS projects are much the same - they require resources. Some companies donate in kind, and that's great, but it's rarely what is needed, and it's easy to get distracted working out what to do with all resources that have been donated, but you don't have an immediate use for.</p> <p>And sadly, just as with charities - many companies don't donate at all. And I'm not claiming these companies are being deliberately malicious in not funding open source - if anything, we as a community have failed them because we haven't helped them help us.</p> <p>Most importantly, we don't have a mechanism in place to make it easy to spend money, and easy to receive money. The current state of affairs clearly demonstrates that it's not enough that there is a lot of money in a community - you have to make the mechanism for donating that money as obvious and seamless as possible, and you have to have someone to direct that money towards.</p> <p>One model community that I think does this really well is the Wordpress community. Wordpress is GPL'd software. There are books, videos, blogs on how to write Wordpress plugins and themes - the same as there would be for any open source software community. But critically, there are also books, videos and blogs on how to make a business writing Wordpress plugins and themes. Wordpress is GPL. And therefore, so are all the plugins. They've got a store where you can buy plugins (and get free ones), and easily install them in your Wordpress instance.</p> <p>The Wordpress ecosystem has fundamentally embraced the fact that money needs to be part of the equation, and by doing so, they've created an industry that is self-funding - and this, I'd argue, is one big reason for the success of Wordpress as a platform.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2016/money-money-money/#a-controversial-proposal","title":"A controversial proposal","text":"<p>In that vein, I'd like to make a controversial proposal.</p> <p>What if PyPI was a revenue stream? What if, when I registered an application with PyPI, I could specify a price - either per install, or per version, or per-app, or per-month. When I <code>pip install</code>, the cost just gets added to my PyPI account, and I get a monthly charge on my credit card; and that gets passed back to the developer projects.</p> <p>If PyPI stats are to be believed, Django is downloaded from PyPI more than 1 million times per month. If there was a 10c toll on each download, that would raise $100,000 per month - enough to pay for 10 full-time well paid developers, or a metric buttload of diversity, outreach, DjangoGirls, and community support.</p> <p>You could also leverage PyPI dependency information to pay it forward - if you're writing a project that depends on another, you could opt to pass some of your revenue upstream. Or, request that downstreams provide a tithe.</p> <p>And then there's the biggest dependencies of all - PyPI and Python itself. If PyPI took a small cut of the revenue raised, that could help pay for the development and maintenance of PyPI - and potentially Python as well.</p> <p>You could also take some of the money collected and put it into a development pool - so if there's a new project that needs some bootstrapping cash to get started, or an established project that needs some help for a big task (like a Python 3 upgrade), the community as a whole can easily funnel money towards that project.</p> <p>What about people who don't have money? Well, we can offer free passes. You're at a DjangoGirls event? Use this promo code to get free access.</p> <p>You can still give away your software at no cost. And it's still free software - you're still delivering Python, so you're still going to get the source. You could probably even make the signing up process completely optional. All we'd be doing is paving the cowpath - making it easy to collect a toll on the easy way to use your software.</p> <p>I'm not going to say that any of this would be easy to implement. Completely aside from any technical challenge and nailing down details, it's a big philosophical change for the community, and that's a much bigger issue. But this philosophical question about money is a discussion that we, as a community need to have.</p> <p>What we've got here is a tragedy of the commons. Everyone agrees this software is good. Everyone knows that software needs to be maintained.

If you make it simple and seamless for a large company to swipe their credit card and get charged $100 a month for using all this open source software that has been developed, they will. Yes, people will cheat. Don't worry about it, as long as cheating isn't easier than doing the right thing.</p> <p>The biggest reason that this isn't happening right now is that it isn't obvious what the \"right\" thing is. I could donate to the DSF or PSF\u2026 but it's a bit fiddly to organize, and it's not clear where the money goes\u2026 I could sign up to a few Patreons, or sign up to a bug bounty program\u2026 but not everybody is there, and those that are aren't really earning enough to make a living, and I don't want to just contribute beer money.</p> <p>So what are we to do? The short answer is \"I don't know\". There probably isn't going to be a silver bullet.

Learning how to write good tests helps you write more robust code, and ensures that when you've written code that works, it keeps working long into the future. It can also help you write better code in the first place. It turns out that well architected code, with high cohesion and low coupling, is also easy to test - so writing code that is easy to test will almost always result in better overall code quality.</p> <p>An important step in \"leveling up\" your testing experience is to start using a Continuous Integration, or CI service. A CI service is a tool that automatically runs your test suite every time someone makes a change - or every time someone proposes a change in the form of a pull request. Using a CI service makes sure that your code always passes your test suite - you can't accidentally slip in a change that breaks a test, because you'll get a big red warning notification.</p> <p>CI is such an important service that many companies exist solely to provide CI-as-a-service. The BeeWare project has, for various projects, used TravisCI and CircleCI. Both these tools provide free tiers for open source projects, and have generously sponsored BeeWare with capacity upgrades at various times.</p> <p>However, the BeeWare has had an interesting relationship with commercial CI services. This is for two reasons.</p> <p>Firstly, our test suites - especially for VOC and Batavia - take a long time to run. These two projects require tests that repeatedly start and shut down virtual machines (for Java and JavaScript, respectively), and no matter how much you optimize the code being tested, the startup and shutdown time of a virtual machine eventually adds up. We also need to run our test suites on multiple versions of Python - at present, we support Python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6, with 3.7 on the horizon. There are also subtle changes in micro versions that may require testing.</p> <p>We've been able to speed up the duration of a test run by splitting up the test suite and running parts of the suite in parallel, but that forces us up against the second problem. Commercial CI services usually operate on a subscription model; higher subscriptions providing more simultaneous resources. However, our usage pattern is highly unusual. Most of the year, we get a slow trickle of pull requests that require testing. However, a couple of times a year, we have a large sprint, and we have a flood of contributions over a short period of time. At PyCon US, we have had groups of 40 people submitting patches - and they all need their submissions tested by CI. And time is a factor - the sprints only last a couple of days, so a fast turnaround on testing is essential.</p> <p>If we were to subscribe to the top tier subscription levels of CircleCi and TravisCI, we still wouldn't have enough resources to support a sprint - but we'd be massively overresourced for the rest of the year. We'd also have to pay $750 or more a month for this service, which is a budget we can't afford.</p> <p>So - we had a problem. To run our test suite effectively, we needed massively parallelized resources to run a test suite quickly; and at certain times of the year, we need extremely large numbers of these resources.</p> <p>We also had other automated tasks that we wanted to perform. We wanted to do code linting (automated checking of code style) before a PR was tested. We wanted to check spelling of documentation. And we wanted these tasks to feed back into GitHub as automated comments and specific code review status markers, informing contributors not just that a problem occurred - but what problem occurred, and where in their code.</p> <p>We also wanted to manage pipeline builds - there's no point in doing a full test of multiple versions of Python once you've established the tests are failing on one version. And there's no point testing at all if there are code style problems.</p> <p>We also wanted to do things that weren't just testing. We wanted to check that contributor agreements have been signed. We wanted to automate deployment of websites and documentation.</p> <p>What we had wasn't just a CI problem. It was a problem where we wanted to automatically run arbitrary code, in a safe way, in response to a GitHub event.</p> <p>I've been trying to find a CI service that can meet our needs for over a year. But over the last year, a few thoughts started to congeal in my head.</p> <ul> <li>Amazon provides a API (EC2) that allows you to spool up machines of varying complexity (up to 64 CPUs, with almost 500GB of RAM), and pay by the minute for that usage.</li> <li>Docker provides the tools for configuring, launching, and running code in an isolated fashion</li> <li>Amazon also provides an API (ECS) to control the execution of Docker containers.</li> </ul> <p>There's nothing specific about AWS EC2 or ECS either - you could just as easily use Linode and Kubernetes, or Docker Swarm, or Microsoft Azure\u2026 you just need to have the ability to easily spool up machines and run a Docker container. After all: a test suite is just a Docker container that runs a script that starts your test suite. A linting check is a Docker container that runs a script that lints your code. A contributor agreement check is a Docker container that checks the metadata associated with a pull request.</p> <p>All you need then is a website that can receive GitHub event notifications, and start Docker containers in response.</p> <p>At the start of July, I found myself between jobs, and uttered the fateful question \"How hard could it be?\" And so, today, I'm announcing BeeKeeper - BeeWare's own CI service.</p> <p>BeeKeeper deploys as a Heroku website, written using Django. After configuring it with GitHub and AWS credentials, it listens for GitHub webhooks. When a Pull Request or Push is detected, BeeKeeper creates a build request; that build request inspects the code in the repository looking for a <code>beekeeper.yml</code> configuration file. That configuration file describes the pipeline of tasks that will be performed, and for each task, the type of machine that should be used, any environment variables that are required, and the Docker image that will be used.</p> <p>BeeKeeper also allows the site admin to describe what resources will be used to satisfy builds. A task can say it needs a \"High CPU\" instance; but the BeeKeeper instance can determine what \"High CPU\" means - is it 4 CPUs or 32? When those machines are spooled up, how long will they be allowed to sit idle before being shut down again? How many machines should be sitting in the pool permanently? And what is the upper limit on machines that will be started?</p> <p>A companion tool to BeeKeeper is Waggle. Waggle is a tool that prepares a local definition of a task so it can be used by BeeKeeper - it compiles the Docker image, and uploads it into ECS so that it can be referenced by tasks. (It's called \"Waggle\" because when worker bees discover a good source of nectar, they return to the hive and do a waggle dance that tells other bees how to find that source).</p> <p>We've also provided a repository called Comb (named after honey comb, the place bees store all the nectar they find) that defines the task configurations that a BeeKeeper instance can use. We've provided some simple definitions as part of the base Comb repository; each BeeKeeper deployment should have one of these repositories of its own.</p> <p>There's still a lot of work to do, but we're already using BeeKeeper to Batavia and VOC, and the upcoming PyCon AU sprints will be our first outing under high-load conditions. Some back-of-envelope calculations predict that for around $50, we'll be able to provide enough CPU resources for each test run to complete running in 10 minutes or less, supporting a sprint of dozens of people.</p> <p>Although BeeKeeper was written to meet the needs of the BeeWare project, it's an open source tool available for anyone to use. If you'd like to take BeeKeeper for a spin, come along to the sprints, or check out the code on GitHub.</p> <p>BeeKeeper is also an example of the sort of product you'd see more of if BeeWare development was funded full time. I was able to build BeeKeeper because I had a spare couple of weeks between jobs. There is no end to the tools and libraries like BeeKeeper and Waggle that could be built to support the software development process - all that is missing is the resources needed to develop those tools. If you'd like to see more tools like BeeKeeper in the world, please consider joining the BeeWare project as a financial member. Every little bit helps, and if we can reach a critical mass of supporters, I'll be able to start working on BeeWare full time.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2017/a-request-for-your-help/","title":"A request for your help","text":"<p>Around 4 years ago, I made the first commit to Cricket - the first tool that would eventually become part of the BeeWare suite. Since then, the BeeWare project has grown to encompass support for mobile platforms, two alternate Python implementations, and a cross-platform widget set - as well as the developer tools that started the project originally.</p> <p>For most of this time, BeeWare has been a volunteer effort. Initially, it was a solo project; however, over the last year in particular, the number of people who have contributed to BeeWare has grown rapidly. Over 300 people have now made contributions to the various BeeWare tools and libraries - due, at least in part, to the Challenge Coins we've been offering at sprints.</p> <p>Of particular note is the team of 7 people who have joined the project as apiarists, helping share the load of project maintenance. I can't thank these people enough - without their assistance, I wouldn't have made anywhere near as much progress over the last year.</p> <p>You may have noticed that over the last few months, progress has been especially rapid. This is because, for the last six months, BeeWare development has been partially funded by very accommodating employers at Jambon Software. My contract with Jambon allowed me to spend significant periods of time being paid to work on BeeWare - and, not surprisingly, it was possible to make enormous progress as a result. The last 6 months has seen:</p> <ul> <li>Extensive improvements to Batavia and VOC;</li> <li>An Android backend for Toga;</li> <li>A Django backend for Toga, enabling Toga apps to be deployed as web apps;</li> <li>A WinForms backend for Toga, enabling Toga apps to run on Windows with a modern appearance;</li> </ul> <p>Unfortunately, my contract with Jambon is coming to a close - which means my contributions to BeeWare will go back to being what my spare time allows.</p> <p>This also means the rate of progress will also slow. There's still plenty to do: there's plenty of the Python standard library to port to Batavia and VOC; Toga needs much wider widget support; Colosseum needs to be extended so it supports the full CSS box model, not just CSS3 Flexbox; and the tools that started it all - Cricket, Bugjar, Duvet, and others - all need to be ported to Toga.</p> <p>I would like to be able to work on BeeWare full time. However, the simple reality is that unless I can find a way to pay for this work, it will only be able happen in my spare time.</p> <p>So - this is an appeal to you - the Python community. If you are excited by the prospect of having access to Python on mobile platforms, or you would like to write applications in Python that have completely native user interfaces - I need your help.</p> <p>For just US$10 a month - you can join the BeeWare project as a member, and help make this dream become a reality. If I can find 1000 people in the Python community who want these these tools and are willing to support their development financially, I can start working on BeeWare full time. Of course, this target is even easier if companies get involved and sponsor at higher tiers.</p> <p>If I can find more than 1000 people, then even more becomes possible. The obvious option would be to hire other experienced developers to assist with the work. The idea of having others to bounce ideas off during the development process is very appealing. However, we can also use this as an opportunity to do some social good.</p> <p>For some time, I've had an open offer to mentor anyone who wants to get involved with Open Source contribution using the BeeWare project. However, not many people have been able to seriously take up this offer, because the time required to seriously take up the offer is prohibitive. I'd like to be able to extend my offer to more than just a casual mentoring relationship. I'd like to be able to hire - and pay - one or more junior developers for the BeeWare project, and focus on giving that opportunity to people from underrepresented demographics.</p> <p>It's still early days for BeeWare. Financial support means faster progress. More widgets. Better documentation. More of everything you\u2019ve seen so far from BeeWare. If I can find full time funding for myself - or better still, for myself and a small team - then I have no doubt that the BeeWare suite will become a viable alternative for commercial projects in very short order. Best of all, we will be able to do this without having to give up on the ideals of the open source movement.</p> <p>I'm excited for what the future holds for BeeWare. I hope you'll join me on this journey.</p> <p>(And if you\u2019re contemplating signing up, and you\u2019re coming to PyCon US in Portland this May, let me drop a gentle hint\u2026 sign up now.

If you'd like to receive regular updates about the BeeWare project, why not subscribe?</p> <p>When you're designing a GUI app - be it for desktop, mobile, or browser - one of the most fundamental tasks is describing how to lay widgets out the screen. Most widget toolkits will use a grid or box packing model of some kind to solve this problem. These models tend to be relatively easy to get started, but rapidly fall apart when you have complex layout needs - or when you have layouts that need to adapt to different screen sizes.</p> <p>Instead of inventing a new grid or box model, the Toga widget toolkit takes a different approach, using a well known scheme for laying out content: Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS. Although CSS is best known for specifying layout in web pages, there's nothing inherently web specific about it. At the end of the day, it's a system for describing the layout of a hierarchical collection of content nodes. However, to date, every implementation of CSS is bound to a browser, so the perception is that CSS is a browser-specific standard.</p> <p>That's where Colosseum comes in. Colosseum is a browser independent implementation of a CSS rendering engine. It takes a tree of content \"nodes\" - such as a DOM from a HTML document - an applies CSS styling instructions to layout those nodes as boxes on the screen. In the case of Toga, instead of laying out <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements, you lay out Box and Button objects. This allows you to specify incredibly complex, adaptive layouts for Toga applications.</p> <p>But Colosseum as a project has many other possible uses. It could be used anywhere that there is a need for describing layout outside a browser context. For example, Colosseum could be the cornerstone of a HTML to PDF renderer that doesn't require the involvement of a browser. It could also be used as a test harness and reference implementation for the CSS specification itself, providing a lightweight way to encode and test proposed changes to the specification.</p> <p>The current implementation is based on Facebook's yoga project - it was originally a line-for-line port of yoga's JavaScript codebase into Python. However, yoga only implements the Flexbox portion of the CSS3 specification.</p> <p>This week, we started a big project: rewriting Colosseum to be a fully standard-compliant CSS engine. The work so far can be found in the globe branch of the Colosseum repository on GitHub. The first goal is CSS2.1 compliance, with an implementation of the traditional CSS box model and flow layout. Once we've got a reasonable implementation of that, we'll look to adding Grid and Flexbox layouts from the CSS3 specification set.</p> <p>This is obviously a big job. CSS is a big specification, so there's a lot of work to be done - but that also means there's lots of places to contribute! Pick a paragraph of the CSS specification, build some test cases that demonstrate the cases described in that paragraph, and submit a patch implementing that behavior!</p> <p>It also highlights why your financial support is so important. While we could do this entirely with volunteered effort, we're going to make much faster progress if a small group of people could focus on this project full time. Financial support would allow up to significantly ramp up the development speed of Colosseum, and the rest of the BeeWare suite.</p> <p>If you would like to see Colosseum and the rest of BeeWare develop to the point where it can be used for commercial applications, please consider supporting BeeWare financially. And if you have any leads for larger potential sources of funding, please get in touch.</p>"},{"location":"news/events/2017/well-be-at-djangocon-au-2017/","title":"We'll be at DjangoCon AU 2017!","text":"<p>Russell, Katie and Amber will be attending DjangoCon AU 2017 on August 04, 2017!</p> <p>DjangoCon AU is annual gathering of Django developers in Australia, celebrating it's 5th year in 2017.

Object creation in the JVM is expensive. This definitely does not mean that the VOC user writing Python should think about minimizing the number of objects that she creates, but rather that any time we can non-trivially reduce the number of objects created during bytecode transpilation or in VOC-defined function calls, we can expect to see a huge performance boost. Integer and boolean preallocation, which is about reusing objects that have already been created, was one of the most significant improvements we made this summer.</p> <p>2. Method calls in VOC are expensive. This is essentially due to the process of invoking a callable: you have to check that the method is defined on the object, then construct it (read: object creation!), and check the arguments, before it can actually be called. (This is done using reflection, which is super interesting and confusing in itself.) And this is the reason why refactoring the Python comparison functions made such a big performance impact, because we were able to circumvent this process.</p> <p>3. Exception-heavy code is expensive. Again, this is not to say that the programmer is on the hook for being frugal when throwing exceptions, but that VOC benefits greatly by avoiding the use of exceptions internally except when strictly necessary. For instance, Python uses <code>StopIteration</code> exceptions to signal the end of a for loop, and they quickly rack up when you have nested loops (everything is ultimately related to object creation!). That was the motivation for the nested loops optimization.</p> <p>If I may be a bit more reflective here, one of the a-ha! moments I had this summer was realizing that to really optimize something, you have to understand where its biggest problems are first. I remember pitching to Russ at the start of the summer things like loop unrolling, constant folding, even converting to SSA-form (you know, stuff I heard about optimization in my compilers class) and he was saying to me, think simpler. While working on my project, I used a profiler to understand exactly which parts of VOC were slow, and that information drove the changes we implemented. I think it worked out pretty well!</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2018/2018-google-summer-of-code---voc-optimization/#future-work","title":"Future Work","text":"<ul> <li>Minimize boxing of primitive types like String and Int.

In late 2019, we choose Asheesh Laroia to do the work. Today, we're proud to announce that BeeWare's Android support has reached a point where it is ready for mass consumption.</p> <p>The BeeWare tutorial has been updated to include an Android track. The tutorial walks you through the process of writing your first app, and deploying it - first as a desktop app, and then on your phone. All you need is a Python install; everything else you need is downloaded automatically by the BeeWare tools as part of the development process.</p> <p>And, to prove that it's real - we have uploaded Travel Tips to the Google Play Store. This is a Python app, in the Google Play Store, deployed from the same source code as the version in the iOS App Store.</p> <p>Huge thanks go to Asheesh for all the work he's put into this project. Delivering Android support in BeeWare has required considerable technical skill, attention to detail, and creative hacks; and Asheesh has consistently delivered. Huge thanks also go to the Education Grants Committee of the Python Software Foundation for the faith they placed in BeeWare when they funded this project. In 6 months (while simultaneously negotiating a world pandemic), we've gone from a nothing to a full Android implementation. Without their financial support, this project would still be a dream.</p> <p>There's still plenty of work to be done, though. There are still a lot of widgets that need Android implementations, and new widgets that we want to add. We'd like to add support for device features like cameras, GPS and accelerometers. We'd like to make it easier to use binary Python packages like NumPy, Keras, and more. And we'd like to merge the work that we've done into CPython itself.</p> <p>All of those are significant projects in themselves, and will require effort comparable to that required to add Android as a supported platform. And so, we're looking for the financial support to make that happen. We're applying for new grants as opportunities arise, but the most helpful source of funds are the ongoing funds that come from memberships. Ongoing funding means we can focus on improving BeeWare, rather than chasing grants. It means being able to hire permanent staff, rather than offering short term contracts. And it means being able to make long term plans and promises to the community.</p> <p>If this project proves anything, it's that money makes things happen.

Or, if you've got experience with commercialization of Open Source projects, or any other ideas for how we could please get in touch.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2021/some-new-ways-to-discuss-beeware/","title":"Some new ways to discuss BeeWare","text":"<p>Today, the BeeWare project is making 2 changes to the way we organize our community.</p> <p>Firstly, we're going to move our real-time chat community from Gitter to Discord.</p> <p>When we originally set up Gitter, it was a strong option for a chat community - especially one that was focused on a software project, due to its tight integration with GitHub. However, over the years, Gitter has undergone multiple changes of ownership, but has remained essentially unchanged - in some cases, it's gotten appreciably worse (their native iOS and Android clients are effectively deprecated). In the meantime, Discord has emerged as a dominant player for community chat. It has a robust mobile client, and really good tools for community moderation, as well as the option of hosting video and voice chats - something we hope to be able to use for coordinating virtual sprints.</p> <p>To join the new BeeWare Discord server, visit this link.</p> <p>Secondly, we're going to start using GitHub Discussions.</p> <p>For many years, we've tried to use GitHub Issues as a pseudo-forum. There's a lot of similarity between how a forum works and how GitHub displays and manages issues. Each \"issue\" is effectively a forum thread, and each comment is a message in that thread. However, there are also some important differences. Issues get closed when they're resolved; forum threads, however, don't necessarily have a resolution. Most importantly, \"closing\" an issue can look like someone is trying to kill discussion - when all they're really trying to do is keep the list of issues manageable.</p> <p>The good news is that GitHub has noticed the similarity too, and has launched GitHub Discussions. Discussions offers a familiar \"forum\" interface, but with the familiar GitHub message interface, and tight integration with GitHub Issues and pull requests.</p> <p>We've enabled Discussions on all the key BeeWare projects - Toga, Briefcase, Rubicon ObjC, Rubicon Java, Colosseum, Travertino and Podium.</p> <p>Naturally, all of these new community spaces - along with all existing BeeWare spaces - are subject to the BeeWare Community Code of Conduct.</p> <p>We hope these two changes will make it easier to participate in the BeeWare community.

BeeWare's iOS support currently relies on static compilation of all binary modules. This was originally done because prior to iOS8, dynamic linking was prohibited on iOS. The days of iOS8 are now long behind us; but the Apple support package has retained this old approach, mostly because it wasn't clear what approach Apple would allow through the App Store review process.

However, I must stress that the fact this is on our roadmap is not as a result of a directive from my employer. The original proposal for this idea predates even my earliest hiring discussions with Anaconda. It is being pursued now for three reasons:</p> <ol> <li>The key value of Conda is that it simplifies the process of delivering complex binary packages, and ensuring that the binary dependencies for those packages are isolated from any packages that might be present on the user's computer. This core problem statement shares a lot of similarities with the core problem associated with application packaging. Conda also has much more nuanced representation of hardware platforms, alternatives for binary artefacts, and options for custom repositories.

We've been able to achieve amazing things with those volunteer efforts, demonstrating that Python is a viable language for GUI development on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android, as well as providing a proof-of-concept demonstration on Web. However, there are still lots of features that we'd like to add, and lots of ongoing maintenance that needs to be done as operating systems and hardware platforms evolve.</p> <p>Over the years, we've been incredibly fortunate to have the financial support of our members. While I'm incredibly grateful for that support, it falls a long way short of even one full-time salary. We've also received grants (such as the PSF grant), and short-term contracts. These grants and contracts have enabled us to add specific (and much needed) features to BeeWare - but they don't provide resources for ongoing development and maintenance.</p> <p>However, the brutal truth is that our rate of progress is severely limited by the volunteered resources at our disposal. As a result, I've spent a lot of time over the last few years thinking about how we can fund the work that needs to be done to make BeeWare the go-to solution for GUI development on desktop, mobile, and more - and do so without compromising the Open Source roots of the project.</p> <p>I'm incredibly excited to announce that I've found a solution.</p> <p>On March 21, I joined Anaconda as a Principal Engineer and Team Lead - and the team I will be leading will be focused 100% on BeeWare.</p> <p>Anaconda is no stranger to Open Source. In addition to indirectly funding a number of community efforts through their Anaconda Dividend program, they directly employ people to work on Numba, Dask, Pyston and more. BeeWare will be joining this stable of projects.</p> <p>Anaconda is supporting BeeWare in this way because they see the potential for Python as a language for GUI development - especially on mobile platforms. Python has established itself as an incredibly popular language in education, science, business and more - and in all those markets, there is potential to develop apps. By adding mobile platform support and app development to the list of tasks to which Python is already incredibly capable, Anaconda hopes to ensure the long term prospects of Python as a language, as well as ensuring a healthy market for the products they sell commercially.</p> <p>BeeWare will continue to be a 100% Open Source project, with all contributions welcome from the community. The only difference is that Anaconda will be directly employing some of the contributors to the project. The conversations I've had with Anaconda's engineering leadership indicates they are acutely aware of the tension that exists between corporate funding and the technical direction of an Open Source project. They've indicated that they want to ensure that BeeWare's technical direction remains independent in both appearance and substance. This includes financial independence - the financial support provided by our members will remain vitally important, as it provides project-level funding for resources such as hosting and promotional materials.</p> <p>The related good news is that part of my job title is \"Team Lead\" - so in the very near future, we'll be looking for people to join me on my team. I'm already working out the details of the team that I'd like to have, so watch this space for hiring announcements.</p> <p>Anaconda has a long history of understanding and contributing to both the Python ecosystem and the Open Source community.

These updates aren't just a version bump - they also added support that enables the iOS emulator to run natively on M1 devices. This required a major restructure of the way the support packages are bundled, using Apple's new XCFramework library packaging format.</li> <li>We addressed an issue with the use of <code>ctypes</code> on physical iOS devices. <code>ctypes</code> is a core part of the infrastructure we use to integrate with the iOS system libraries, so resolving this bug was critical for distributing apps. The fix was deep in the core of libFFI, and has been submitted for integration into the upstream project.</li> <li>We released an Android support package for Python 3.10, as well as updated support packages for Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. These support packages dramatically are now dramatically smaller, and result in smaller end-user applications, thanks to some compiler flag optimizations suggested by the community.</li> <li>We began the process of adding support for Python 3.11 to the Apple and Android support packages. This is the first time BeeWare has been able to contribute pre-release testing to the CPython project. In the process, we discovered a small backwards incompatibility. Baring major incidents, we should be in a position to release BeeWare's support for Python 3.11 on the same day as the official 3.11.0 is finalized.</li> <li>We developed an acceptance test suite for the Apple and Android support packages. This test suite tests for features in the Python core that have a history of being broken (such as modules in the standard library that have binary components, but have been incorrectly compiled or inadvertently excluded from the build). This test suite isn't yet formally integrated into the build process, but the hope is that it will be in the near future.</li> <li>We modified Briefcase so that it is able to run the Android emulator on M1 hardware. This required a major rebuild of the way the Android SDK tooling is managed.</li> <li>We made further improvements to the log capture tools on macOS. This ensures that the first few seconds of application logs are reliably captured, and the log stream is terminated when the app exits.</li> <li>We started the introduction of Black as a part of BeeWare's development tooling. BeeWare's repositories have always enforced code style guidelines, and those code styles are very closely aligned with Black's choices. With Black formally moving out of Beta status at the start of this year, the time has come to start adopting Black as a formal project requirement. For now, Briefcase is the only project that has formally adopted Black, but you can expect this to continue to roll out over the other projects in BeeWare over the coming months.</li> <li>We resolved some minor bugs that were present in the 0.3.0dev33 release of Toga. Most important of these was a bug that prevented the BeeWare tutorial running on iOS devices.</li> </ul> <p>Many of these changes either began as, or are entirely the work of community members. There are also plenty of smaller PRs, bug fixes, and bug reports that are just as important, but are too numerous to list.

This new approach has two major advantages - firstly, it means third-parties can register their own backends; but more importantly, it means that code no longer needs to explicitly provide a backend.

Along with support for binary modules, this change has the added benefit of faster startup times, and less bugs at runtime. This means you'll need to re-generate any Android project - the Python source code should work as-is, but there's no simple way to convert the Android Gradle project from the older Rubicon base to the newer Chaquopy base.</p> <p>On iOS, we've reworked how the support packages are constructed, and added support for installing binary modules from a BeeWare-specific package repository that includes builds of iOS binary wheels. We've also added asset signing to the iOS Xcode project - and applied the same changes to the macOS backends. Of course, this also means you'll need to re-generate any iOS project to take advantage of these changes.</p> <p>While we are now able to support binary packages on mobile platforms, this doesn't mean that every binary package is automatically supported. Binary wheels need to be compiled for mobile platforms, and compiling for mobile platforms can be complicated. However, we've compiled ~40 of them most popular packages with binary components (including NumPy, Pandas, Cryptography, Pillow and Matplotlib), and made them available as dependencies. In order to get working builds, some of these packages are slightly older versions (e.g., cryptography is a version from before the introduction of the rust dependency); however, we've endeavored to provide the most recent versions possible.</p> <p>A full list of supported packages can be found on the Chaquopy package repository for Android, and the BeeWare repository for iOS. If your project uses one of these packages, you only need to add them to the <code>requires</code> definition in your <code>pyproject.toml</code>, then update and re-build your project, and you're done.</p> <p>If there\u2019s a package you want that isn't on this list, you'll need to request a binary wheel. For Android, open a ticket on the Chaquopy repository. For iOS, open a ticket on this repository. If you're adventurous, you can also try building wheels yourself. The issue trackers are on a project that has as \"forge-like\" tool for building wheels, in the <code>server/pypi</code> folder; there are tools and documentation describing how to build a package.

Getting the first tests in place has proved to be much more complex than we anticipated. In order to test widgets at all, we've had to set up all the infrastructure that will be necessary to test every other widget, such as defining the probes to inspect colors and fonts, and to ensure that the GUI framework has finished applying changes before performing a test assertion. The process of building the first tests has exposed a number of problems deeply embedded in the core of Toga - problems that either aren't observable or are easily masked when you're writing an application as a user, but can't be avoided when you're writing a test suite that will run fast and needs to have repeatable behavior. We're also testing the limits of the features exposed by each platform - and everything we do needs to be repeated on 5 GUI toolkits with 5 completely different views of the world.</p> <p>The good news is that as of the end of Q1, we're finally getting traction on the problem. We're about a quarter of the way through the widgets by count. Admittedly, we've been tackling the simpler widgets first - but the lessons learned (and bugs fixed) making those simple widgets work should make testing the more complex widgets easier. There's also some commonality in the more complex widgets - for example, <code>TextInput</code>, <code>PasswordInput</code> and <code>NumberInput</code> are all essentially the same widget, so once tests are built for one of them, the other 2 should fall out reasonably easily.</p> <p>We have also been able to release Toga v0.3.0.

This may sound a little underwhelming - after all, Toga has had a Button widget for a long time, and has been fairly reliable.

It has also required setting up all the infrastructure that will be necessary to test every other widget, such as defining the probes to inspect colors and fonts, and to ensure that the GUI framework has finished applying changes before performing a test assertion). We've also taken this opportunity to start migrating the Toga unit tests to <code>pytest</code>, which promises to significantly improve our testing capabilities.</li> <li>We formalized the relationship between Toga's Pack layout model and CSS. This should make it a lot easier to determine what \"correct\" layout behavior should be.</li> <li>We identified a low level issue with the way that layout is performed on GTK, and possibly with other platforms. We're still working through the consequences of this change, but it has indirectly resolved a number of issues we have seen reported with widget layouts, especially on GTK.</li> <li>We've added the ability to pass command line arguments to running apps from the <code>briefcase dev</code> and <code>briefcase run</code> interface. This was primarily done to make it easier to run unit test suites; but it can be used for any other reason you might want to use a command line argument.</li> <li>We have a draft implementation of a Linux system packaging backend for Briefcase. We've had consistent problems with both AppImage and Flatpak, most of which can be traced back to resolving links to system packages. We're not going to remove these backends - when AppImage and Flatpak work, they're great options - but we're going to change the default packaging backend on Linux to be system packages (i.e., DEB/RPM etc). This makes the simple case of building a package for your own system much easier, while retaining the ability to build packages for other distributions as required.

BeeWare has a lot of GitHub repositories, and a lot of common tasks (such as rolling out an app across multiple Python and operating system versions). Previously, each GitHub repository had an independent set of CI task definitions; we've now got a central collection of task definitions that is used by all repositories.</li> <li>We cleaned up the table in Toga's documentation describing the state of support of each widget.

Development versions of Toga will now report a specific version control commit; release versions have their version determined by the git tag used to produce the release.</li> <li>We completed a major review of the way we're using GitHub issue labels, and modified those labels to be consistent across all repositories.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2023/january-2023-status-update/#whats-next","title":"What's next?","text":"<p>Much of the last 3 months have been spent getting a GUI testing framework in place for Toga.

We now have 7 widgets fully tested, with another 2 in progress. As with last month's update, getting these tests passing has required wrestling a lot of fundamentals, in particular around the simulation of events such as mouse clicks. We're also discovering (and fixing) lots of corner cases in widget implementations that only surface when you're doing rigorous and repeatable testing.</li> <li>We've made some major changes to the way GTK widgets are rendered. This change significantly reduces the amount of re-rendering that is performed by GTK, as well as resolving a number of long standing issues related to resizing widgets.</li> <li>Thanks to some community contributions, we were were able to add support for focus events and text alignment on GTK's <code>TextInput</code> widget, and support for text alignment and fonts on GTK's <code>NumberInput</code> widget.</li> <li>We landed the implementation of a Linux system package backend for Briefcase, which can output DEB and RPM packages. Thanks to a community contribution, we were also able to add support for Arch packages</li> <li>We modified the locations where Briefcase outputs build artefacts. This removes some sources of bugs associated with tools not supporting spaces in filenames, and makes Briefcase's output consistent with other tools in the Python ecosystem.</li> <li>We made significant progress on modifying Briefcase's AppImage and Flatpak backends to use Indygreg's Standalone Python, rather than BeeWare's Linux support package. Standalone Python is becoming a de facto standard for pre-compiled Python builds (especially on Linux), so it makes sense for BeeWare to converge on this common standard. This change will also significantly speed up Flatpak builds, should be more stable on AppImage, allows us to switch to manylinux base images - and it reduces the number of projects that BeeWare is responsible for maintaining. We're currently waiting on a fix to the linuxdeploy GTK plugin to be merged before we can land this change.</li> <li>Thanks to a community contribution, we added support for Pygame to Briefcase.</li> <li>We migrated BeeWare's CI to use the new System packaging backend on Linux. This means that CI is significantly faster, as building system packages requires a lot less processing than an AppImage.</li> <li>We released Travertino 0.2.0. Travertino is the library that underpins Toga's Pack layout algorithm. It's been several years since we last did a Travertino release, but some recent bug fixes warranted an update.</li> <li>We presented a tutorial at Everything Open 2023.</li> </ul> <p>We also made a big change to our social media strategy: we started a Mastodon account.

This led to some re-examination of how CPython could be delivered on iOS without using that argument. As a result of that discussion, modifications to use CPython as a dynamically loaded framework have been prepared. Although the original focus of this work was iOS, the same change will be also used for macOS - which means BeeWare no longer needs to compile a macOS support package (although we will still be lightly re-packaging the official CPython installer).</li> <li>We modified Toga's Image APIs so that Pillow images can be used as source data.</li> <li>We switched CI testing of Android apps to use a Linux machine. This wasn't previously possible, because GitHub didn't expose the necessary permissions in their Linux images; however, now that is possible, our Android tests run up to 5 times faster, and are less likely to be held up in CI because of availability of macOS testing machines.</li> <li>We corrected an issue on macOS where an OS-level setting controlling the use of tabs could cause test failures in the Toga test suite.</li> <li>There have been some extended discussions and draft PRs related to Toga's Application base class, and the addition of support for status icons. These PRs are still in active development, but they will open up some interesting possibilities for Toga apps when they are completed.</li> <li>Briefcase, Toga and Rubicon ObjC were all modified to use PEP621 metadata, removing the need for <code>setup.cfg</code>, <code>setup.py</code>, and <code>MANIFEST.in</code> files. As part of this change, we wrote a new <code>setuptools</code> plugin to allow for dependencies to be dynamically defined.</li> <li>We modified Briefcase so that answers to the new project wizard and values for configuration settings when running commands can be overridden at the command line. This is mostly useful for testing purposes - it's now possible to generate a project and build it against a local template or support package build without needing to modify a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file or override input handling.</li> <li>We refactored the new project wizard so that support for GUI toolkits is generated by an extensible plugin. Although we still ship with support for Toga, PySide, Pygame and PPB, this support is provided through a public interface, allowing other GUI toolkits to provide Briefcase with toolkit-specific modifications to the new project.</li> <li>We switched the default Android skin used by Briefcase from the Pixel 3a device skin to the Pixel 7 skin. This is an entirely cosmetic change, but it does mean that screenshots will use a device that looks a little more modern.</li> <li>We've made significant progress on the modifications to Chaquopy to support CPython 3.12.

We've hit a bunch of complications with getting fonts and canvas support working on Windows and Android, and the process of getting those platforms working has revealed some inconsistencies in macOS, iOS and GTK font handling. However, we have completed the audit of <code>DetailedList</code> and Font, and the audit of Canvas is almost complete.</li> <li>We decoupled the WinForms event loop from the main form in a Toga app. This doesn't have any immediate impact on existing Toga apps - but it means we're now in a position to have windowless apps, such as system tray apps.</li> <li>We completed the fixes needed to support Briefcase on Python 3.12.</li> <li>We made some significant improvements to subprocess encoding handling. This should significantly improve the user experience of Windows users, and users from non-English speaking countries.</li> <li>We formally downgraded our support for AppImage to \"Best effort\". AppImage has proven increasingly difficult to work with as a format; now that we have native system packages and Flatpak as options, the effort needed to maintain AppImage support is better spent elsewhere. We'll still merge fixes to AppImage support if a PR is provided, but we're no longer actively fixing bugs, or running AppImage configurations in CI.</li> <li>We added filters to Xcode output to hide ignorable warnings. Xcode builds have always been a little noisy; the new Xcode 15 release added even more noise. The filter means that these warnings will no longer distract from successful build output.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2023/september-2023-status-update/#whats-next","title":"What's next?","text":"<p>Unfortunately, we didn't complete the Toga audit in September as we anticipated.

Through this, I developed stronger communication and collaboration skills and gained a better understanding of how individual contributions fit within a larger shared goal, especially when it comes to coding workflows.</p> <p>I've improved my Python skills and gained real experience with <code>pytest</code> and Playwright while working on the Toga Web Testing prototype. Most importantly, I learned how to design a cross-process system that bridges a <code>pytest</code> test runner to an app running in the browser, which gave me a much deeper understanding of both testing frameworks and web automation.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2025/2025-curtin-university-capstone-project---year-end/#jaeden","title":"Jaeden","text":"<p>Beginning with limited Python knowledge increased the learning curve for me however by reflecting at the end of this journey I can see the difference in skills I have gained.

Consistently sharing progress, even in small increments, made collaboration far more effective.</p> <p>Finally, I learned the importance of handover reports and how essential they are for communicating the current state and future direction of a project. A well-written handover report provides clarity on what has been implemented, what has not worked as intended, and what areas require further development or refactoring. It also serves as a bridge for future contributors, ensuring that knowledge is not lost and that others can continue the work without repeating past mistakes.

It's been very eye opening navigating the expectations and workflows that come with contributing to a community-driven codebase. During the first semester, I found that I didn't know how much to push or when to create a PR. This meant that Russell couldn't perceive work being completed and that I could not receive help in situations where I was stuck. With our semester 2 work, especially as we were working in pairs, I made it a goal to commit and push any slight change. This drastically improved our collaboration efforts.</p> <p>I've also gained confidence and appreciation for modular architecture through working on the PyScript insertion system. Previously, having only worked on smaller codebases of my own or for group assignment work, I've never truly worked on multiple systems that would interact with each other. Having spent time reconfiguring dependencies within BeeWare, I've now learned the value of planning and researching before implementation. The untangling of Toga and the Static Web Template has been some of the most fun I've had within programming thus far. I'm looking forward to seeing how BeeWare continues to make use of and expand on this system.</p> <p>Collaborative feedback and reviews from Russell, Malcolm, and the team, especially Kavidu have undoubtedly improved our code quality and allowed me to grow as a software engineer.

We were unable to achieve this goal, for four reasons.</p> <p>Firstly, we underestimated the chain of downstream dependencies that needed to be addressed before it would be possible to submit mobile packaging PRs to upstream projects. We correctly identified <code>pip</code> and <code>cibuildwheel</code> as two projects that would need to be updated; however, we didn't anticipate that those projects would themselves have upstream dependencies and issues that would require patching. The process of coming up to speed with the development tooling of multiple upstream projects, navigating the review processes of each of those projects, and sequencing changes over multiple projects so they are easier to merge has taken much longer than we anticipated.</p> <p>Secondly, we underestimated how much work would be needed on the target projects themselves to make them ready for mobile support. We picked Pillow as one of our target projects because of its complex chain of binary dependencies. However we soon discovered that the way those binary dependencies were compiled for macOS required significant alteration before working on an iOS patch would be possible.</p> <p>Third, the release of Xcode 16 included an unexpected surprise - it broke the mechanism we were using to gather results from test suites running on the iOS simulator. This required a significant change in CPython; however, as a result, we now have a much better mechanism for collecting test results, and the test harness the CPython uses to run its own tests can now be used to run test suites for any other Python project.</p> <p>Lastly, we were presented with an opportunity to work closely with the PyScript team on web support, to the benefit of both projects. This redirected some of the resources that we originally anticipated would be used for Android binary packaging. However, it does mean that some significant improvements to Toga's web backend have been made, with more on the horizon in the new year.</p> <p>Despite these challenges, we have made significant progress. <code>pip</code> now includes full support for iOS wheel tags. The patch adding a major feature to <code>cibuildwheel</code> that is a pre-requisite for iOS support has been accepted; we've been told this patch should be merged within days. We've submitted changes to Pillow that allow macOS builds to be completely isolated from Homebrew, and the patches required to support cross-platform builds of Pillow's binary dependencies have been merged. This leaves 2 patches that need to be merged - a patch to <code>cibuildwheel</code> adding support for building on iOS; and the patch to Pillow adding an iOS build configuration. These patches have been prepared, and are mostly ready for submission upstream; using these patches, it is possible to fully build and test Pillow wheels for iOS with <code>cibuildwheel</code>.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2025/2025q1-roadmap/#q1-priorities","title":"Q1 priorities","text":"<p>In Q1, we will continue to work on binary packaging for mobile platforms. We will continue to work on landing the patches to <code>cibuildwheel</code> and Pillow for iOS support; once that work has concluded, we hope to start making the analogous changes required to support Android.</p> <p>Q1 will also see the continuation of our collaboration with PyScript. The major focus for BeeWare in this work will be Toga's Web backend - and in particular, Toga's testing infrastructure. We're not currently able to run Toga's testbed project on the web backend (or the Textual backend, for that matter). We have some ideas for how this could be addressed; these ideas may not be fully realized by the end of Q1, but we hope to at least have a concrete plan, and maybe even a prototype in place.</p> <p>Lastly, with the CPython 3.14 development process well underway, there are two projects that we intend to work on, with the goal of having this work incorporated into Python 3.14. The first is the creation of official \"embedded\" distributions of CPython for more platforms. Python already produces an embedded build for Windows, and Briefcase is able to use this distribution as part of the process of creating Windows binaries. We hope that Python 3.14 will contain analogous builds for macOS, iOS and Android, removing the need for BeeWare (and other projects) to maintain independent CPython builds. We've had some initial discussions with the CPython release team; we hope that by the end of the quarter, we'll have a plan for how to deliver this work.</p> <p>The second CPython feature we'd like to address is handling of cross-platform virtual environments - that is, creating a virtual environment that can \"pretend\" it is running on a different host platform. This is necessary for cross-platform builds, which require the ability to create an isolated PEP 517 build environment that can run Python on the local machine, but report platform-identifying information as if it were running on the target machine. A version of this cross-environment virtualization has been necessary to support <code>cibuildwheel</code>; however, it would be desirable to upstream this work so that it can be standardized as part of a stock Python environment.

You can now download official, pre-compiled Android binaries for CPython. This is a major milestone for Android support, as it means BeeWare is able to use official binaries when building Android apps.</li> <li>As part of the changes adding official Android binaries to the release process, Android was added to the CI checks that are performed as part of every CPython pull request on GitHub. This will significantly reduce the likelihood of bugs landing in main that will break the Android buildbots.</li> <li>We spent a significant amount of time dealing with an update to GitHub Actions. On August 11, GitHub rolled out an update to the disk image they use for macOS 15 machines - and in the process, broke the tools that BeeWare uses to test iOS applications. It took almost a week to identify the cause of this problem, and develop a fix. However, the good news is that the fix significantly simplifies the iOS testing process.</li> <li>We began the process of adding official Python binaries for iOS. The complexity of iOS multi-architecture builds makes official builds a little more complicated than Android, but we're hopeful this work will be able to land in the near future.</li> <li>We added a recipe for building iOS binaries for <code>zstandard</code>. These are needed to support the new <code>zstandard</code> compression library in Python 3.14.</li> <li>We released a website to track the status of binary wheel support for iOS and Android.</li> <li>We released Briefcase 0.3.25. This release was primarily required because of a change to Android Play Store target SDK requirements.</li> <li>We modified how Briefcase determines the minimum supported macOS/iOS version that Python requires. This change allows us to simplify the contents of the support packages.</li> <li>We made Briefcase more resilient to badly packaged binary wheels on macOS. Many packages publish <code>py3-none-any</code> wheels, which should be platform independent - but then include platform-specific binaries or dynamic library content in the wheels. Briefcase will now ignore these files.</li> <li>Briefcase's unit tests have been made more resilient to temporary network outages - something that happens surprisingly often in the GitHub Actions environment.</li> <li>We dropped support for Python 3.9, and added support for Python 3.14 across BeeWare projects. For the first time, this includes the ability to release Windows support based on pre-releases of Python - previously, we had to wait until the <code>.0</code> release of a new Python version before we could add support.</li> <li>We improved the checks (and error reporting) associated with using new versions of Travertino with old versions of Toga.</li> <li>We resolved a long standing bug on iOS where touch events wouldn't be triggered if content was \"below the fold\" on a scroll container.</li> <li>We started work on a new tool to consolidate the cross-platform building tools used on Android, iOS and Emscripten. This tool still needs a lot of work before it's production-ready, but it draws from our lessons learned on <code>cibuildwheel</code>, and should allow us to simplify and consolidate the approaches taken to implement cross-platform builds.</li> <li>We made significant progress on migrating BeeWare's documentation to use Markdown, instead of Restructured Text. We've got tools and themes in place, and the tutorial is almost ready to switch to new Markdown-based content.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2025/august-2025-status-update/#whats-next","title":"What's next?","text":"<p>September will involve a lot of travel - we'll be attending PyCon AU, the CPython core team summit, and PyCon UK.

This simplifies the implementation process, and guarantees that the initial styles added to a widget are always applied.</li> <li>We added an API for reporting and controlling the state of Toga windows.</li> <li>We began modifying Toga to be compatible with MicroPython. MicroPython is significantly smaller than the full CPython install, reducing the startup time for web apps.</li> <li>We updated Briefcase's web template to use a more recent PyScript version.</li> <li>We added support for console apps in the Briefcase project conversion wizard.</li> <li>We improved error handling when updating Briefcase templates, accounting for some global git configuration options that were causing problems for some users.</li> <li>We added explicit support for passing options to pip when installing dependencies with Briefcase.

This is ultimately a very small change adding a list of allowed tags to the underlying PyPI codebase - but it is an important step towards the goal of having the Python ecosystem support iOS and Android as a first class citizen.</li> <li>We submitted a pull request adding iOS support to <code>cibuildwheel</code>. With this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS with a single command: <code>CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</code>. As proof, we built and published iOS wheels for a simple binary package. For completeness, we also built and uploaded Android wheels using our existing Chaquopy-based build tooling; in the near future, we're hoping to replace that with a <code>cibuildwheel</code>-based approach as well.</li> <li>We completed a major refactor of the BeeWare website. This dramatically simplifies the structure of some parts of the website - most notably, the projects page. A huge thanks to community member Kattni for all their hard work on this refactor.</li> <li>We released Briefcase 0.3.22. This is a bug fix release to silence a warning raised during builds caused by the release of pip 25.0. This warning had the potential to become an error at an unknown point in the future, so we decided to push out a low-feature release to avoid that possibility.</li> <li>We released Toga 0.4.9. This release contains only 1 change over the 0.4.8 release - it imposes an upper bound on the version of Travertino that it specifies as a requirement. This ensures that when we release the next version of Travertino, we don't need to accommodate compatibility with Toga 0.4 APIs.</li> <li>We added initial support for GTK4 to Toga. This is only the very initial phases of GTK4 support - most widgets aren't currently supported - but the basic infrastructure that allows a GTK4 app to start at all now exists. We now need to go through the process of porting every GTK widget for GTK4 compatibility. Thanks to the work we did on the Toga 0.4 widget audit, we have a comprehensive test suite that we can use to evaluate progress on this task.</li> <li>We corrected some issues with background color handling on Windows, including adding support for transparency on widget backgrounds. This also included adding support for alpha blending to Travertino.</li> <li>We corrected a long-standing issue that caused instability in Toga's iOS tests.</li> <li>We corrected a problem with the CPython iOS test runner that prevented multiple test runners starting at the same time, and another problem that was caused when running the runner under CI conditions.</li> <li>We upgraded the CPython iOS buildbot to run on macOS Sonoma, and Xcode 16.4; this some issues with iOS 18 compatibility that we have resolved.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2025/february-2025-status-update/#whats-next","title":"What's next?","text":"<p>In March we will continue to work on binary packaging. Although it is now possible to upload binary wheels to PyPI, that capability isn't much use unless projects are able to build those wheels in the first place. In the process of developing the pull request for <code>cibuildwheel</code>, we've identified a gap in the PEP 517 specification associated with building more complex binary packages, and a set of missing features in virtual environments in a cross-platform build configuration. We have some ideas for how to fill these gaps; but we need to do some more experimentation to prove that those approaches will work as expected. The eventual goal will be to author a PEP to address these gaps in the PEP 517 standard. We should also be able to begin the process of adding Android binary wheel support, mirroring the changes we've made for iOS over the past months.</p> <p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten buildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to resolve, and then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython buildbot fleet.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it looks like the work we were planning on Toga's Web backend will be deferred. We believed we may have had an opportunity to work with another group at Anaconda to improve Toga's web backend, but that opportunity looks like it will not eventuate.

It's been over 5 months since our last feature release of Toga; this release includes a number of major improvements to Toga's style layer, and some significant improvements in iOS and macOS memory handling. This release includes a number of backwards incompatible changes; check the Toga 0.5.0 release notes for details.</li> <li>We added a new Toga-Positron bootstrap. This bootstrap is a Briefcase plugin that provides an easy way to start a new project that uses a web browser as the primary UI. This is effectively the equivalent of Electron-style apps - but the code is entirely written in Python, and works on iOS and Android. It also allows for hybrid apps: as the underlying app is a Toga app, you can mix Toga widgets into the layout that is being used. The bootstrap allows you to convert a Django website or static web server into a mobile app; it also provides a way to generate a \"single site browser\" - converting a single public URL into a standalone app on your desktop.</li> <li>We modified the way that style properties are applied to Toga widgets. Style updates are now applied in batch updates, dramatically reducing the amount of repeated work required when changing the appearance of a widget.</li> <li>We improved the UX of the WinForms Table widget, ensuring that the selected row is still visible when a table doesn't have focus.</li> <li>We improved Toga's handling of the <code>asyncio</code> event loop on Windows. This change ensures that WinForms apps always clean up the event loop on exit; previously, it was possible for warnings to be raised on application exit, caused by open sockets and un-<code>await</code>ed co-routines.</li> <li>We modified the handling of alignment style properties to ensure that when text direction is changed, the layout of the app is re-evaluated.</li> <li>We added support for controlling inter-line spacing in multi-line text on a canvas.</li> <li>We corrected some issues with background color handling on Android.</li> <li>We corrected some issues with supporting PyGObject on Linux distributions that are based on Debian 12 (including Ubuntu 22.04). This was necessary because of a backwards incompatible change introduced into the PyGObject 3.52.1 release; unfortunately, users of older Linux distributions may need to make some modifications to their projects.</li> <li>The pull request adding iOS support to <code>cibuildwheel</code> has been merged. With this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS with a single command: <code>CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</code>. This PR then required a follow-up investigation and fix to correct an intermittent issue that was seen when running the <code>cibuildwheel</code> tests in CI.</li> <li>We've started work on a follow-up PR to <code>cibuildwheel</code>, adding support for explicitly declaring safe cross-build tools. This is a use case that was identified during the development of PR for iOS support.</li> <li>We corrected a long standing issue with <code>PTH</code> file handling in Briefcase.</li> <li>We added the ability to invoke <code>briefcase build</code> and <code>briefcase package</code> on a single application in a Briefcase project.</li> <li>We began work on a patch to support generating iOS binary wheels for NumPy. This is a work in progress; we've got a set of patches that allows us to compile NumPy, but the test suite won't run yet.</li> <li>We created a process to make an official binary release of Python for Android, which should be available on python.org starting with Python 3.14. This will reduce duplicated effort across Python on Android tools, and ensure binary compatibility in the packaging ecosystem.</li> <li>We submitted pull requests adding Android support to packaging and pip.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2025/march-2025-status-update/#whats-next","title":"What's next?","text":"<p>Binary packaging will continue to be an area of focus in April. In addition to finishing the work on the \"safe cross-build tools\" patch, we will continue to work on porting \"real world\" packages (like NumPy) to discover any gaps that exist in the mobile packaging story. During April, we also hope to submit a PR to support Android in <code>cibuildwheel</code>; and to start a discussion with the rest of the Python packaging community about the use of cross-platform build environments.</p> <p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten buildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to resolve, and then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython buildbot fleet.</p> <p>There's also good news for Toga's Web backend - a group of students from Curtin University will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their final year capstone project. This will include making modifications to Briefcase to support testing web-based apps. Some of the improvements to Toga and Briefcase that landed this month are the result of those students becoming familiar with BeeWare's contribution process. This project will run until the end of the year; we look forward to seeing the progress they're able to make.</p> <p>Looking a little further ahead - in May, we'll be attending PyCon US! We're presenting a talk and a tutorial; and we'll be there for the first 3 days of the sprints. We'll have a presence at the Anaconda booth in the main hall; we'll be attending other events (such as the language summit) during the conference; and we're hoping to plan some open spaces.

Many of the contributions described in this blog post come from PyCon US contributions.</li> <li>Our proposed changes to Meson and Meson-python have all been accepted, and will be included in the next releases of those tools. There have been some other conversations with the Meson team that have led to some minor improvements in the features added to support mobile binary packaging.</li> <li>We made a major set of updates to the BeeWare website, transitioning all the content to Markdown, and moving the translation infrastructure to Weblate.</li> <li>We modified the Briefcase new project wizard to draw default values from a user's Git configuration, where possible</li> <li>We modified Briefcase's handling of licenses to use SPDX standard abbreviations</li> <li>We optimized the handling of signing on macOS to remove a redundant ad hoc signing pass when packaging an app</li> <li>We improved warnings for users who have an old version of Python, which would result in them having an old version of Briefcase, but be unaware of this fact.</li> <li>We modified Briefcase to use the system certificate store. This should remove a very common source of errors on some corporate-managed VPNs. We also improved error handling to provide more context for any remaining SSL or related connection errors.</li> <li>We improved error messages when one of the required wheels can't be found on iOS and macOS</li> <li>We corrected the events that are generated by Tables on Windows.</li> <li>We improved the error handling when an app doesn't return valid window content as part of its startup method</li> <li>We added a mechanism for detecting dark mode on Android</li> <li>We significantly improved the handling of type annotations, allowing for Toga's lazy loading main module.</li> <li>We made some modifications to the <code>WebView</code> widget, adding support for setting content at time of construction, and simplifying the interface for setting static content</li> <li>Our student contributors have continued to work on Toga's web backend.

We're now at a point where the code required to support iOS is mostly in place; and the code to support Android is almost in place; however, it will be difficult to make further progress until those changes are available in public releases.</p> <p>So, in June, we'll be changing focus. We're aiming to take a look at Briefcase, with 2 major improvements in mind. Firstly, we want to upgrade our Windows packaging story, and upgrade our WiX support from WiX 3 to a current version. This should resolve some issues with packaging large apps and apps with lots of files; it should also enable us to package applications for ARM64. Secondly, we've had some requests to expose Briefcase's packaging and signing infrastructure so it can be used on projects that aren't built with Briefcase - we're hoping to add this as well.</p> <p>We're also hoping to follow up on some of our discussion with the Python core team at PyCon, and begin the process of integrating the production of iOS and Android binary artefacts into Python releases. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which will hopefully limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p> <p>Lastly, we'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support. Last month, we thought we were one issue away from a working buildbot; however, some new issues have emerged since then. We still hope to have a working buildbot before 3.14 is finalized, which will restore Emscripten to Tier 3 status.</p>"},{"location":"news/buzz/2025/may-2025-status-update/#want-to-get-involved","title":"Want to get involved?","text":"<p>Want to get involved?

As a result, we've been able to publish Rust-based iOS wheels for Cryptography to the BeeWare package repository. Once the changes to Maturin and PyO3 have been formally released, we'll be able to submit PRs adding official iOS builds to Cryptography.</li> <li>We completed a large refactor of BeeWare's documentation. The BeeWare website now has a clear \"Documentation\" heading, and all of BeeWare's main projects serve their documentation from <code>beeware.org</code> subdomains.</li> <li>We expanded the BeeWare tutorial to include a section on runtime icon handling.</li> <li>We completed an update to Chaquopy, the tooling underpinning Briefcase's Android support, adding support for Python 3.14, as well as a number of other updates to adapt to changes in the Android ecosystem.</li> <li>We released a number of Android wheels for Python 3.10, for packages which were previously only available for the end-of-life Python 3.8.</li> <li>We added integration with PDB and VSCode debuggers for Briefcase apps. This allows users to use their IDE to debug Windows, Linux, macOS and iOS apps. Support for Android should be added soon. Support for PyCharm and other debuggers should also be possible given the debugging framework that has been put in place.</li> <li>We added the ability to customize the install directory, and configure pre-uninstall options in Windows MSI installers.</li> <li>We modified <code>briefcase dev</code> to install local source paths in editable mode.</li> <li>We added support for a cross-platform Bluetooth permission in Briefcase apps.</li> <li>We improved Python version detection when building apps on Linux.</li> <li>We added a new Qt backend to Toga!

We also modified the Positron static plugin to set headers that are necessary for using <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> in an app.</li> <li>We made some improvements that improve the reliability of some Toga tests.</li> <li>We contributed a new feature to <code>cibuildwheel</code> that allows the specification of arguments to the test executor. This was primarily needed to provide a workaround for some instability in GitHub Actions, but it has the added benefit of adding configurability to some test execution functionality that was previously hard coded.</li> <li>We corrected an issue with how the iOS testbed handles command-line arguments with spaces.</li> <li>We made a small modification to the iOS XCFramework build process to add a <code>lib</code> folder.

This is part of a larger set of changes cleaning up the implementation of <code>Canvas</code>.</li> <li>We added the ability to add a bitmap image on a <code>Canvas</code>.</li> <li>We made a large internal refactor of the <code>Table</code> and <code>Tree</code> widgets. This is the first step in improving the API for defining <code>Table</code> and <code>Tree</code> widgets to exposed some long-needed capabilities like sorting and specifying column widths.</li> <li>We hardened the definition for providing icons in <code>Table</code> and <code>Tree</code> column data. The documented API has been specific for some time, but hasn't been implemented consistently on all platforms.</li> <li>We modified the way Source objects are used to ensure that widgets no longer listen to stale sources when data changes.</li> <li>We formalized the protocol definitions for data source listeners</li> <li>We corrected some issues with the display of <code>OptionContainer</code>s on Cocoa and GTK when content is changed on a non-visible tab.</li> <li>We corrected a number of layout issues on iOS and iPad apps, including introducing the ability for iPad apps to operate in non-full screen mode.</li> <li>We corrected some issues with scroll handling in <code>ScrollContainer</code> on macOS.</li> <li>We corrected some issues with widget colors in dark mode on macOS.</li> <li>We corrected some memory leak issues with Android widgets.</li> <li>We added the ability to use the Python standard library <code>webbrowser</code> module in Toga Android apps.</li> <li>We corrected the use of theme colors in <code>DetailedList</code> on Android.</li> <li>We added the ability to be notified when a website completes loading on Android. This API feature was previously possible on every platform except Android.</li> <li>We corrected the handling of icon sizes on buttons on Windows</li> <li>We simplified the categories used in Toga's API reference docs.</li> <li>We clarified the documentation around using Toga with a Python version other than the system default.</li> <li>We added documentation of Toga's platform and backend selection APIs.</li> <li>We ensured that content added to an <code>OptionContainer</code> or <code>SplitContainer</code> can accurately track the Window and App they are associated with.</li> <li>We completed work on patches to NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn and xgboost allowing these projects to be built for Android. This also involved updates to tools including <code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>auditwheel</code>, Meson, and Python's own Android testbed. We hope to upstream these patches to the corresponding projects in the near future.</li> <li>We resolved an issue with Android buildbot testing in CPython. Both Android Buildbots stopped working in mid December for two different reasons; the cause of the problems is not entirely understood, but we were able to find workarounds and restore Buildbot testing.</li> <li>We are nearing completion on a replacement for BeeWare's website. The new website will use the same MkDocs infrastructure that is used for our tutorial and project documentation. This will add dark mode, search capabilities, improved event and resources pages, and some other content simplifications to our website. It will also make our job easier as maintainers, as website builds are much faster, and adding new content to the site is easier.</li> <li>We released updated Apple support packages for all supported Python versions. These updated versions are the first to adopt the XCFramework layout that has been accepted upstream by CPython, including scripts for managing the process of processing binary libraries on iOS.</li> <li>We added the ability to reset all runtime permissions when running an app on Android.</li> <li>We added the ability to merge folders named in <code>sources</code> and <code>test_sources</code> in a Briefcase configuration. This allows projects to overlay platform-specific content over a base project layout.</li> <li>We added the ability for Windows MSI installers to reference the location of the original MSI in post-install scripts.</li> <li>We improved our documentation of the use of signing identities.</li> <li>We added the ability to open a single Briefcase app in a project that contains multiple app definitions.</li> <li>We modified our System PySide library to support some common KDE extensions.</li> <li>We corrected an issue with Toga Chart that prevented the example app from running on Android.</li> <li>We corrected an issue with the handling of background images in DMGs on macOS Tahoe.</li> <li>We corrected some issues with parsing the <code>size</code> and <code>text-size</code> properties and color hex regexes when creating DMGs.</li> </ul> <p>Much of this work is due to the contributions of members of the BeeWare community.
