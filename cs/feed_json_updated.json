Both Android\n  Buildbots stopped working in mid December for two different reasons; the cause\n  of the problems is not entirely understood, but we were able to find\n  workarounds and restore Buildbot testing.</li>\n<li>We are nearing completion on a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/website/issues/4\">replacement for BeeWare's\n  website</a>. The new website will\n  use the same MkDocs infrastructure that is used for our tutorial and project\n  documentation. This will add dark mode, search capabilities, improved event\n  and resources pages, and some other content simplifications to our website. It\n  will also make our job easier as maintainers, as website builds are much\n  faster, and adding new content to the site is easier.</li>\n<li>We released <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/releases\">updated Apple support\n  packages</a> for all\n  supported Python versions.

We're now at a point where the code\nrequired to support iOS is mostly in place; and the code to support Android is\n<em>almost</em> in place; however, it will be difficult to make further progress until\nthose changes are available in public releases.</p>\n<p>So, in June, we'll be changing focus. We're aiming to take a look at Briefcase,\nwith 2 major improvements in mind. Firstly, we want to upgrade our Windows\npackaging story, and upgrade our WiX support from WiX 3 to a current version.\nThis should resolve some issues with packaging large apps and apps with lots of\nfiles; it should also enable us to package applications for ARM64. Secondly,\nwe've had some requests to expose Briefcase's packaging and signing\ninfrastructure so it can be used on projects that <em>aren't</em> built with Briefcase\n- we're hoping to add this as well.</p>\n<p>We're also hoping to follow up on some of our discussion with the Python core\nteam at PyCon, and begin the process of integrating the production of iOS and\nAndroid binary artefacts into Python releases. This will hopefully also involve\nintegrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which will\nhopefully limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break\niOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support. Last month, we\nthought we were one issue away from a working buildbot; however, some new issues\nhave emerged since then. We still hope to have a working buildbot before 3.14 is\nfinalized, which will restore Emscripten to Tier 3 status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-get-involved\">Want to get involved?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#want-to-get-involved\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Want to get involved?

It's\n  been over 5 months since our last feature release of Toga; this release\n  includes a number of major improvements to Toga's style layer, and some\n  significant improvements in iOS and macOS memory handling. This release\n  includes a number of backwards incompatible changes; check the <a href=\"https://toga.beeware.org/en/stable/about/releases/#backward-incompatible-changes_3\">Toga 0.5.0\n  release\n  notes</a>\n  for details.</li>\n<li>We added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3114\">Toga-Positron\n  bootstrap</a>. This bootstrap is a\n  Briefcase plugin that provides an easy way to start a new project that uses a\n  web browser as the primary UI. This is effectively the equivalent of\n  Electron-style apps - but the code is entirely written in Python, and works on\n  iOS and Android. It also allows for hybrid apps: as the underlying app is a\n  Toga app, you can mix Toga widgets into the layout that is being used. The\n  bootstrap allows you to convert a Django website or static web server into a\n  mobile app; it also provides a way to generate a \"single site browser\" -\n  converting a single public URL into a standalone app on your desktop.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3273\">modified the way that style properties are applied to Toga\n  widgets</a>. Style updates are now\n  applied in batch updates, dramatically reducing the amount of repeated work\n  required when changing the appearance of a widget.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3293\">improved the UX of the WinForms Table\n  widget</a>, ensuring that the selected\n  row is still visible when a table doesn't have focus.</li>\n<li>We improved Toga's <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3270\">handling of the <code>asyncio</code> event loop on\n  Windows</a>. This change ensures that\n  WinForms apps always clean up the event loop on exit; previously, it was\n  possible for warnings to be raised on application exit, caused by open sockets\n  and <nospell>un-<code>await</code>ed</nospell> co-routines.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3268\">modified the handling of alignment style\n  properties</a> to ensure that when\n  text <em>direction</em> is changed, the layout of the app is re-evaluated.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3217\">added support for controlling inter-line spacing in multi-line text on a\n  canvas</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3118\">corrected some issues with background color handling on\n  Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3256\">corrected some issues with supporting PyGObject on Linux distributions\n  that are based on Debian 12 (including Ubuntu\n  22.04)</a>. This was necessary because\n  of a backwards incompatible change introduced into the PyGObject 3.52.1\n  release; unfortunately, users of older Linux distributions may need to make\n  some modifications to their projects.</li>\n<li>The pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2286\">adding iOS support to\n  <code>cibuildwheel</code></a> has been\n  merged. With this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS\n  with a single command: <code>CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</code>. This PR then\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2337\">required a follow-up investigation and\n  fix</a> to correct an\n  intermittent issue that was seen when running the <code>cibuildwheel</code> tests in CI.</li>\n<li>We've started work on a follow-up PR to <code>cibuildwheel</code>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2317\">adding support for\n  explicitly declaring safe cross-build\n  tools</a>.

In addition to\nfinishing the work on the \"safe cross-build tools\" patch, we will continue to\nwork on porting \"real world\" packages (like NumPy) to discover any gaps that\nexist in the mobile packaging story. During April, we also hope to submit a PR\nto support Android in <code>cibuildwheel</code>; and to start a discussion with the rest of\nthe Python packaging community about the use of cross-platform build\nenvironments.</p>\n<p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten\nbuildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to resolve,\nand then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython buildbot fleet.</p>\n<p>There's also good news for Toga's Web backend - a group of students from Curtin\nUniversity will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their final year\ncapstone project. This will include making modifications to Briefcase to support\ntesting web-based apps. Some of the improvements to Toga and Briefcase that\nlanded this month are the result of those students becoming familiar with\nBeeWare's contribution process. This project will run until the end of the year;\nwe look forward to seeing the progress they're able to make.</p>\n<p>Looking a little further ahead - in May, we'll be attending PyCon US!

As a result, we've been able to submit pull\n  requests for <a href=\"https://github.com/amitdev/lru-dict/pull/73\"><code>lru-dict</code></a> and\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/9030\">Pillow</a>, proposing the\n  addition of iOS support. Work on <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2349\">adding Android\n  support</a> is still underway.</li>\n<li>An <a href=\"https://buildbot.python.org/#/builders/1810\">Emscripten CPython buildbot is now\n  live</a>! The buildbot is currently\n  failing 2 tests; but having a buildbot <em>at all</em> is a major step towards\n  restoring Tier-3 support, and will help detect regressions on Emscripten as a\n  platform.</li>\n<li>We've started a big review of the structure of our documentation, with a view\n  to resolving a number of inconsistencies between platforms. This review will\n  also involve a visual refresh, making BeeWare docs have a style consistent\n  with the homepage; and improvements to how the documentation for BeeWare's\n  individual projects fit into the overall BeeWare website.</li>\n<li>We added <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2336\">iCloud detection to\n  Briefcase</a>. iCloud Drive\n  synchronization adds metadata to some folders that prevents signing\n  infrastructure from working; this has been a recurring source of problems\n  during tutorials.</li>\n<li>We massively <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2284\">improved file type associations for\n  macOS</a>. Briefcase previously\n  supported macOS file associations, but expressed some very specific opinions\n  on how files would be used. With these new improvements, it should be possible\n  to support almost any macOS file type association requirements that an\n  application might have.</li>\n<li>We modified Briefcase so <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2333\">it can package, sign and notarize applications that\n  weren't built with Briefcase</a>.\n  We've spent a lot of time automating the processes for building installers,\n  and for managing signing and notarization - and almost none of that work\n  depends on using Briefcase to build the app being packaged. With these\n  modifications, you can now point Briefcase at an app that was built with a\n  different tool, and Briefcase will manage the packaging and signing that is\n  required.</li>\n<li>We've started the process of <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2355\">upgrading Briefcase to use a newer version of\n  WiX for Windows MSI\n  packaging</a>.</li>\n<li>We added a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3527\">Slider widget to the Web\n  backend</a>.</li>\n<li>We added a <code>DateInput</code> widget to the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3483\">iOS</a> and\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3574\">macOS</a> backends.</li>\n<li>We added a <code>TimeInput</code> widget to the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3536\">iOS</a> and\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3574\">macOS</a> backends.</li>\n<li>We added an <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3473\"><code>ActivityIndicator</code> widget to the WinForms\n  backend</a>.</li>\n<li>We modified the handling of Toga app paths so that <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3543\">requesting a path\n  guarantees that it exists</a>. This is\n  a significant improvement to user experience, as it's no longer necessary to\n  \"check and create\" every time you access an app path.</li>\n<li>We resolved a long-standing instability in the macOS and iOS testbed app that\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3557\">caused intermittent failures in the <code>WebView</code>\n  tests</a></li>\n<li>We added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3552\">topic guide on managing file system access in Toga\n  apps</a>.</li>\n<li>We modified the handling of font specifications in Toga apps. You can now\n  provide <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3526\">a list of fonts</a>, as you\n  would in CSS, and the first available font in that list will be used.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3570\">corrected a number of issues with document-based\n  apps</a>. This was detected while\n  upgrading Podium, BeeWare's slide presentation tool, to use a recent version\n  of Toga.</li>\n<li>Our Curtin students <a href=\"../2025-curtin-university-capstone-project---semester-end/\">delivered their mid-year\n  report</a> - including plans for the\n  work they're intending to complete in the second half of the year.</li>\n<li>We completed the process of migrating BeeWare's core projects to use Ruff,\n  rather than a combination of <code>flake8</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>pyupgrade</code>, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's next?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-next\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>With the public release of <code>cibuildwheel</code> 3.0, we've been able to start\nsubmitting pull requests upstream for projects to officially support iOS. In\nJuly, we'll continue that work, with the aim of having some official iOS wheels\nfor major projects that <em>aren't</em> published by BeeWare.

This is\n  ultimately a very small change adding a list of allowed tags to the underlying\n  PyPI codebase - but it is an important step towards the goal of having the\n  Python ecosystem support iOS and Android as a first class citizen.</li>\n<li>We submitted a pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2286\">adding iOS support to\n  <code>cibuildwheel</code></a>. With this\n  change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS with a single\n  command: <code>CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</code>. As proof, we <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pyspamsum/1.0.7/#files\">built and published\n  iOS wheels for a simple binary\n  package</a>. For completeness,\n  we also built and uploaded Android wheels using our <a href=\"https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/blob/master/server/pypi/README.md\">existing Chaquopy-based\n  build\n  tooling</a>;\n  in the near future, we're hoping to replace that with a <code>cibuildwheel</code>-based\n  approach as well.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/578\">completed a major refactor of the BeeWare\n  website</a>. This\n  dramatically simplifies the structure of some parts of the website - most\n  notably, the projects page. A huge thanks to community member\n  <a href=\"https://kattni.com\">Kattni</a> for all their hard work on this refactor.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.22/\">released Briefcase 0.3.22</a>.\n  This is a bug fix release to silence a warning raised during builds caused by\n  the release of pip 25.0. This warning had the potential to become an error at\n  an unknown point in the future, so we decided to push out a low-feature\n  release to avoid that possibility.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.9/\">released Toga 0.4.9</a>. This release\n  contains only 1 change over the 0.4.8 release - it imposes an upper bound on\n  the version of Travertino that it specifies as a requirement. This ensures\n  that when we release the next version of Travertino, we don't need to\n  accommodate compatibility with Toga 0.4 APIs.</li>\n<li>We added <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3087\">initial support for GTK4 to\n  Toga</a>. This is only the very\n  initial phases of GTK4 support - most widgets aren't currently supported - but\n  the basic infrastructure that allows a GTK4 app to start <em>at all</em> now exists.\n  We now need to go through the process of porting every GTK widget for GTK4\n  compatibility. Thanks to the work we did on the Toga 0.4 widget audit, we have\n  a comprehensive test suite that we can use to evaluate progress on this task.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2484\">corrected some issues with background color handling on\n  Windows</a>, including adding support\n  for transparency on widget backgrounds. This also included adding support for\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3140\">alpha blending to Travertino</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3181\">corrected a long-standing issue that caused instability in Toga's iOS\n  tests</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129200\">corrected a problem with the CPython iOS test\n  runner</a> that prevented\n  multiple test runners starting at the same time, and <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130292\">another problem that was\n  caused when running the runner under CI\n  conditions</a>.</li>\n<li>We upgraded the CPython iOS buildbot to run on macOS Sonoma, and Xcode 16.4;\n  this some issues with iOS 18 compatibility that we have resolved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's next?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-next\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In March we will continue to work on binary packaging. Although it is now\npossible to upload binary wheels to PyPI, that capability isn't much use unless\nprojects are able to build those wheels in the first place. In the process of\ndeveloping the pull request for <code>cibuildwheel</code>, we've identified a gap in the\n<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/\">PEP 517</a> specification associated with\nbuilding more complex binary packages, and a set of missing features in virtual\nenvironments in a cross-platform build configuration. We have some ideas for how\nto fill these gaps; but we need to do some more experimentation to prove that\nthose approaches will work as expected. The eventual goal will be to author a\nPEP to address these gaps in the PEP 517 standard. We should also be able to\nbegin the process of adding Android binary wheel support, mirroring the changes\nwe've made for iOS over the past months.</p>\n<p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten\nbuildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to resolve,\nand then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython buildbot fleet.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it looks like the work we were planning on Toga's Web backend\nwill be deferred. We believed we may have had an opportunity to work with\nanother group at Anaconda to improve Toga's web backend, but that opportunity\nlooks like it will not eventuate. We're still interested in improving the web\nbackend, but we probably won't be able to commit significant resources to that\nproject in the near future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-get-involved\">Want to get involved?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#want-to-get-involved\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Want to get involved?

This includes\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3054\">adding a \"justify-content\" style\n  directive</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3036\">adding a \"gap\" style\n  directive</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3033\">updating a number\n  of Pack properties to match their CSS\n  names</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2942\">standardized the way in which Toga widgets are\n  instantiated</a>. This simplifies the\n  implementation process, and guarantees that the initial styles added to a\n  widget are always applied.</li>\n<li>We added an API for <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2473\">reporting and controlling the state of Toga\n  windows</a>.</li>\n<li>We began modifying Toga to be <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2976\">compatible with\n  MicroPython</a>. MicroPython is\n  significantly smaller than the full CPython install, reducing the startup time\n  for web apps.</li>\n<li>We updated <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2080\">Briefcase's web template to use a more recent PyScript\n  version</a>.</li>\n<li>We added <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2089\">support for console apps in the Briefcase project conversion\n  wizard</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2085\">improved error handling when updating Briefcase\n  templates</a>, accounting for\n  some global git configuration options that were causing problems for some\n  users.</li>\n<li>We added <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2059\">explicit support for passing options to\n  pip</a> when installing\n  dependencies with Briefcase. This is mostly useful for specifying alternative\n  package repositories (with <code>--index-url</code> or <code>--extra-index-url</code>) or local\n  folders that contain wheels (with <code>--find-links</code>); but any pip arguments can\n  be passed down to the pip invocation.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2075\">corrected an error in the default D-Bus configuration of Flatpak\n  apps</a>.</li>\n<li>We resolved a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/543\">long-standing memory management issue in\n  Rubicon</a>. This change\n  removes almost all need for manual memory management of ObjC objects, making\n  iOS and macOS development much more robust. It also resolves some memory leak\n  issues on Toga's iOS backend.</li>\n<li>We added support for CPython to <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/127592\">stream <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> to the system\n  log on iOS and macOS</a>. This\n  change included a improved tool for running CPython test suites, making it\n  possible to stream the output of a CPython test suite while the test suite is\n  running, and to run the an arbitrary test suite, not just the CPython test\n  suite.</li>\n<li>Our patch <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2062\">adding a test-sources configuration in\n  <code>cibuildwheel</code></a> has been\n  accepted, and should be merged in a couple of days.</li>\n<li>We reviewed a large number of improvements to Emscripten support in CPython.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's next?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-next\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>We'll publish a full Q1 roadmap in a day or two; but our goal for January will\nbe to continue the work we were doing in December. We'll continue to push\npatches upstream to support binary packaging, with iOS support for Pillow being\nthe immediate goal. We'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support, and\nToga's Web backend, with the eventual aim of getting the web backend to the same\nlevel of support as the other Toga backends. We're planning to publish new\nversions of Rubicon ObjC, Travertino and Toga in the coming days; these are\nmajor updates that will involve some minor backwards incompatibilities.

You can now download\n  official, pre-compiled Android binaries for CPython. This is a major milestone\n  for Android support, as it means BeeWare is able to use official binaries when\n  building Android apps.</li>\n<li>As part of the changes adding official Android binaries to the release\n  process, <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/137186\">Android was added to the CI checks that are performed as part of\n  every CPython pull request on\n  GitHub</a>. This will\n  significantly reduce the likelihood of bugs landing in main that will break\n  the Android buildbots.</li>\n<li>We spent a significant amount of time <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/12777\">dealing with an update to GitHub\n  Actions</a>. On August 11,\n  GitHub rolled out an update to the disk image they use for macOS 15 machines -\n  and in the process, broke the tools that BeeWare uses to test iOS\n  applications. It took almost a week to identify the cause of this problem, and\n  develop a fix. However, the good news is that <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138018\">the fix significantly\n  simplifies the iOS testing\n  process</a>.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138176\">began the process of adding official Python binaries for\n  iOS</a>. The complexity of iOS\n  multi-architecture builds makes official builds a little more complicated than\n  Android, but we're hopeful this work will be able to land in the near future.</li>\n<li>We added a recipe for building <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps/pull/64\">iOS binaries for\n  <code>zstandard</code></a>.\n  These are needed to support the new <code>zstandard</code> compression library in Python\n  3.14.</li>\n<li>We released a <a href=\"https://beeware.org/mobile-wheels/\">website to track the status of binary wheel support for iOS and\n  Android</a>.</li>\n<li>We released <a href=\"http://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.25/\">Briefcase 0.3.25</a>.\n  This release was primarily required because of a change to Android Play Store\n  target SDK requirements.</li>\n<li>We modified how Briefcase <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2443\">determines the minimum supported macOS/iOS version\n  that Python requires</a>. This\n  change allows us to simplify the contents of the support packages.</li>\n<li>We made Briefcase <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2429\">more resilient to badly packaged binary wheels on\n  macOS</a>. Many packages publish\n  <code>py3-none-any</code> wheels, which <em>should</em> be platform independent - but then\n  include platform-specific binaries or dynamic library content in the wheels.\n  Briefcase will now ignore these files.</li>\n<li>Briefcase's unit tests have been made <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2434\">more resilient to temporary network\n  outages</a> - something that\n  happens surprisingly often in the GitHub Actions environment.</li>\n<li>We dropped support for Python 3.9, and added support for Python 3.14 across\n  BeeWare projects. For the first time, this includes the ability to release\n  Windows support <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2432\">based on pre-releases of\n  Python</a> - previously, we had\n  to wait until the <code>.0</code> release of a new Python version before we could add\n  support.</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3683\">improved the checks (and error reporting) associated with using new\n  versions of Travertino with old versions of\n  Toga</a>.</li>\n<li>We resolved a long standing bug on iOS where <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3680\">touch events wouldn't be\n  triggered if content was \"below the fold\" on a scroll\n  container</a>.</li>\n<li>We started work on a <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/xbuild\">new tool to consolidate the cross-platform building\n  tools used on Android, iOS and Emscripten</a>.\n  This tool still needs a lot of work before it's production-ready, but it draws\n  from our lessons learned on <code>cibuildwheel</code>, and should allow us to simplify\n  and consolidate the approaches taken to implement cross-platform builds.</li>\n<li>We made significant progress on migrating BeeWare's documentation to use\n  Markdown, instead of Restructured Text. We've got <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/beeware-docs-tools\">tools and themes in\n  place</a>, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeware/beeware-tutorial/pull/3\">tutorial is\n  almost ready to switch to new Markdown-based\n  content</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's next?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-next\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>September will involve a lot of travel - we'll be attending <a href=\"https://2025.pycon.org.au\">PyCon\nAU</a>, the CPython core team summit, and <a href=\"https://2025.pyconuk.org/\">PyCon\nUK</a>.

Tickets are still\navailable - we hope to see you there!</p>\n<p>Allowing for travel time, just attending PyCon US will take up almost 2 weeks of\nMay. For the rest of the month, we'll be continuing to work on binary packaging\n- iOS patches for NumPy (including the tools to build NumPy) are almost\ncomplete. Android support in <code>cibuildwheel</code> is also progressing; once those\nchanges are in place, and a <code>cibuildwheel</code> version with iOS and Android support\nhas been officially released, we will be able to start officially submitting\npatches to upstream projects to support iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Progress on Python Emscripten support stalled this month due to other\ncommitments.

As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide\nto what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard\ncommitment to features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>\n<p>This Q4 roadmap has been published a little later than normal so that we can fit\nin with quarterly planning cadence at Anaconda (who employ two of the BeeWare\ncore team). Going forward, you can expect that BeeWare's quarterly plans will be\npublished a couple of weeks into the quarter.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h2 id=\"q3-progress\">Q3 progress<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q3-progress\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The end of Q3 sees the release of a new Python version - 3.14. The 3.14 release\ncontains official Android binary artefacts, and a number of improvements to the\niOS build process that will lead to official iOS binary artefacts, hopefully in\nthe near future. It also contains restored support for Emscripten as a Tier 3\nsupported platform. Landing these improvements in 3.14, and ensuring that the\nBeeWare ecosystem is in a position to use those changes, was a subject of\nconsiderable effort in Q3. We were also forced to respond to a number of\nsignificant changes to the GitHub Actions macOS ecosystem - work that is ongoing\nas a side effect of macOS 26 changes and the deprecation of Intel as a supported\nmacOS platform.</p>\n<p>We continued to make progress on the state of binary packaging for iOS and\nAndroid. <code>cibuildwheel</code> 3.1 included support for Android that we contributed; as\na result, it is now possible for projects to have CI pipelines that generate\nboth iOS and Android wheels. We now have a <a href=\"https://beeware.org/mobile-wheels/\">leaderboard of mobile wheel support\nin Python</a>, and we're starting to see others\nin the Python community contribute iOS and Android support updates to popular\nPython projects. We've also been able to consolidate some of the work that we've\ndone on establishing cross-platform environments into a single standalone\npackage - <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/xbuild/\"><code>xbuild</code></a> - that can be used to\nreplicate the functionality that <code>cibuildwheel</code> relies on for cross-platform\nbuilds.</p>\n<p>We made many improvements in Briefcase's Windows installer support. This began\nwith migrating to a current version of WiX, which then allowed us to add several\nnew features, including displaying a license agreement, offering installation\noptions, and running custom installer and uninstaller scripts.</p>\n<p>BeeWare's documentation has also seen some significant improvements. Building on\nthe improvements to the website, we've been able to begin switching our\ndocumentation from using reStructuredText to Markdown. reStructuredText is a\nmarkup standard that is historically significant in the Python community, but\nsees very little use elsewhere. It's clear that the rest of the online world has\nadopted Markdown, and Markdown is also significantly simpler as a syntax; we're\nhoping that these two factors should make it easier for new contributors to get\ninvolved in BeeWare development, and simplify some documentation tasks for\nBeeWare maintainers. We've already ported many of our READMEs, our tutorial, and\nToga's documentation to Markdown format, with more changes to come.</p>\n<p>Our students from Curtin University have almost concluded their capstone\nprojects. As a result, Briefcase now has significantly improved deployment\noptions for web-based projects, and the foundations for some significant\nimprovements to how Briefcase uses virtual environments are in place. Although\nour students will be signing off shortly, we expect to be able to deliver some\nsubstantial improvements to Briefcase using these features in the coming\nquarter.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we had a successful attendance at EuroPython, PyCon AU, and PyCon UK,\npresenting multiple talks, tutorials, and introducing a large number of people\nto Open Source contribution through the sprints. We also attended the Python\nCore Team sprint, providing a great opportunity to finalize some details in the\n3.14 release, and discuss our plans for the upcoming 3.15 release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"q4-priorities\">Q4 priorities<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#q4-priorities\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Q4, we're hoping to make one final push on binary packaging for mobile\nplatforms. In addition to wrapping up work on some of the more notable\nscientific Python packages (such as NumPy and Pandas), we intend to look into\npackages that are built using Rust. Rust is becoming an increasingly important\npart of the Python binary ecosystem, and Rust already has support for iOS and\nAndroid. However, we need to make sure that Python/Rust tools like Maturin are\nable to support cross compilation.</p>\n<p>We also want to wrap up our work getting iOS binary artefacts as part of the\nCPython release process, and work on getting those artefacts into use with\nBriefcase. This will require some improvements to Briefcase, making use of the\n<code>xbuild</code> package, and the work contributed by our Curtin University students.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longer-term-goals\">Longer term goals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#longer-term-goals\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Looking to 2026, after 2 years of building a foundation for a stable, officially\nsupported story for Python on mobile, we can turn our attention back to the apps\nthat people build with BeeWare. This will mean filling some functionality gaps\nin Toga to satisfy some common app requirements, and writing more documentation\nand tutorials to help people write apps with BeeWare's tools.</p>\n<p>We're also expecting that 2026 will see more integration between BeeWare's tools\nand other packaging tools. We're already exploring ways that Briefcase can\nintegrate better with Conda. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the\nBriefcase development story, and some of the changes landed by our Curtin\nstudents make exploring these options much easier.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-03-02T02:10:57.920649+00:00", "date_published": "2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "russell@beeware.org (Russell Keith-Magee)"}], "tags": ["Buzz"]}]}
