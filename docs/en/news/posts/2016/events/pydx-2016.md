    PyDX is a community-driven Python workshop in Portland, focusing on
    ideas, projects, and best practices in need of more attention in an
    inclusive and welcoming environment. Philip and Swenson will both be in
    attendance and speaking. Although they won't be speaking on BeeWare,
    they're keen to talk to anyone who wants to chat!
