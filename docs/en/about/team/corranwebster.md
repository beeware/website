Dr Corran Webster is a mathematician who has been building graphical user interfaces in Python since the 90's and has been active in the scientific Python world for many years, including a stint as co-chair of the SciPy conference. His roles over the years have ranged from academic to data scientist to software developer to manager to open source hacker, but always with a common thread of being a teacher and mentor.

Corran is the Founder and Principal at [Unital Software](https://unital.dev) and is an instructor for scientific Python training courses at [Diller Digital](https://dillerdigital.com). When not writing Python code, he cooks, messes around with micro-controllers and T-gauge trains, and will clean the cobwebs off that mountain bike any day now.
