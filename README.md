# beeware.org

This is the homepage for the [BeeWare project](http://beeware.org).

It is a [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org)-based site.

## Getting started

To view a local build of this website, create a virtual environment, and install the development requirements:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ python -m pip install --group dev
```

Then from the root directory of the checkout, run:

```sh
(venv) $ tox -e docs-live
```

This will [start a web server](http://127.0.0.1:8042) that will automatically reload whenever you make a change to site content. This will only build the English version of the site; to build and test the *full* site, run:

```sh
(venv) $ tox -e docs-all,docs-serve
```

This will also [start a web server](http://127.0.0.1:8042); however the content will *not* automatically reload.

## Financial support

The BeeWare project would not be possible without the generous support of our financial members:
